# Stage 01 Advisory, Dependency, and Architecture Intelligence — Shopify CLI

Generated: 2026-05-01  
Target: `/Users/codiologies/Desktop/oss-to-run/shopify-cli`  
Repository identity: `shopify/cli` (resolved via git remote).  
Current checked-out HEAD observed during audit: `c3e54bea421d23743b5f2b83b34347f5bb729cc4`.

## Executive Summary

No public first-party CVE/GHSA/OSV advisory was found for the published Shopify CLI workspace packages queried (`@shopify/cli`, `@shopify/cli-kit`, `@shopify/create-app`, `@shopify/theme`, `@shopify/app`, `@shopify/store`, and plugin packages). However, Stage 01 found:

- **9 structured GHSA/OSV advisories affecting current direct dependency versions** in the lockfile: `liquidjs@10.25.0`, `lodash@4.17.23`, and `vite@6.4.1`.
- **4 project-hosted non-CVE security signals** in release notes / git history: GraphiQL authorization hardening, theme-dev CORS hardening, GraphiQL script-context XSS hardening on a non-main branch, and a critical Windows `treeKill` command-injection fix that exists on remote branches but is **not an ancestor of current HEAD**.
- **22 vulnerable lockfile package-version entries / 29 unique GHSA records** across direct and transitive dependencies from OSV querybatch, including a critical `protobufjs@7.5.4` advisory reachable through OpenTelemetry telemetry dependencies until proven otherwise.

Primary audit focus for later phases: **localhost browser-facing dev servers**, **template/config/file parsing**, **process execution / external binary management**, and **OAuth/session/token flows**.

## Historical Coverage Metadata

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Tier reached | Tier 2 (all-time expansion). Recent first-party public advisory count was 0, below the 15-advisory signal threshold. |
| Inventory rows in this report | 13 total: 9 official GHSA/OSV direct-dependency advisories + 4 project-hosted non-CVE security signals. |
| Recent vs older | Recent 2yr: 12 rows; older: 1 row (2023 GraphiQL random-key hardening). Public first-party advisories: 0 all-time from queried structured sources. |
| Severity distribution (inventory rows) | CRITICAL: 1, HIGH: 6, MEDIUM: 5, LOW: 1. |
| Repository identity | `shopify/cli` resolved via git remote. |
| Git history available | true (`PIGOLIUM_GIT_AVAILABLE=true`; `.git` available). |
| Source 1 local signals | Ran grep over docs/release notes and git history. No CVE/GHSA IDs in markdown/txt/rst; security commits/release notes found. Raw evidence: `piolium/tmp/source1-local-security-signals.txt`. |
| Source 2 GitHub Security Advisories | `gh api` attempted but blocked by invalid gh credentials (HTTP 401 bad credentials). Supplementary unauthenticated GitHub REST checks for first-party packages and repo advisories returned 0. Coverage gap recorded. |
| Source 3 OSV | First-party package query returned 0 advisories. Versioned direct-dependency query returned 9 advisories. Full lockfile OSV query found 22 vulnerable package-version entries / 38 package-version advisory hits. |
| Source 4 NVD | Keyword query found `CVE-2026-35525` (LiquidJS) via `shopify theme`; direct advisory CVSS enriched via NVD `cveId` queries where available. |
| Source 5 WebSearch | Not used; structured sources and curl/API lookups were sufficient, and user warned WebSearch only returns fallback in this environment. |
| Patch-commit discovery | Local git was available. Project-hosted signal diffs saved under `piolium/tmp/local-security-diffs/`. Upstream dependency patch commits taken from OSV/GHSA references. No first-party public advisory version-to-version diff was applicable because public first-party advisories were not found. |
| Coverage gaps | GitHub `gh api/graphql` source unavailable due invalid token; private Dependabot alert details (#91/#108) referenced by commits are not accessible without repository security access; some local security commits are on non-main remote branches and require merge-state verification. |

### B. Project-hosted non-CVE security signals

| ID | Severity | CVSS | Affected versions / scope | Patch commit(s) | CWE IDs | Inferred component | Description |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---|---|
| LOCAL-GIT-2026-treeKill-command-injection | CRITICAL (commit-labeled) | N/A | Current `main` at `c3e54bea` still shows pre-fix `Number.isNaN(rootPid)` + `exec(\`taskkill /pid ${pid}\`)`; fix exists only on remote branches | `f4de6ef1ab`, `0b38241657` (not ancestors of current HEAD) | CWE-78 | `@shopify/cli-kit` process-tree cleanup / Windows `taskkill` | Windows PID string validation allowed shell metacharacters before replacing `exec` with `spawn` and strict `/^\d+$/` validation. |

Notes:

- `LOCAL-GIT-*` rows are not public CVE/GHSA records. They are included because the repo itself labels or describes them as security fixes and they materially shape audit targeting.
- For `treeKill`, the checked-out source still shows the vulnerable pre-fix pattern at `packages/cli-kit/src/public/node/tree-kill.ts` while fix commits exist on remote branches. Treat as a **high-priority merge/regression target** in Phase 2/5 rather than as a resolved historical issue.

## Vulnerability Pattern Analysis

### Component Vulnerability Heatmap

| Component / module | Count | Severity distribution | Dominant bug types | Heat flag |
|---|---:|---|---|---|
| `@shopify/cli-kit` Liquid template rendering / app init + extension template copy (`liquidjs`) | 5 | HIGH: 2, MEDIUM: 2, LOW: 1 | Symlink/root restriction bypass, arbitrary file read, info disclosure, resource exhaustion | **HIGH-HEAT** (3+ advisories) |
| App dev GraphiQL local server | 2 | HIGH: 2 | Broken auth / missing random key, script-context XSS/config injection | **HIGH-HEAT** (recurring security fixes) |
| UI extensions Vite dev/build tooling | 2 | HIGH: 1, MEDIUM: 1 | Dev-server WebSocket arbitrary file read, optimized-deps path traversal | Medium/high |
| `@shopify/cli-kit` common object helpers via `lodash` | 2 | HIGH: 1, MEDIUM: 1 | Code injection in template helper, prototype pollution via path operations | Medium/high |
| Theme dev localhost proxy/server | 1 | MEDIUM: 1 | CORS policy/data exposure from localhost server | Medium |
| `@shopify/cli-kit` process management / `treeKill` | 1 | CRITICAL: 1 | Windows command injection through shell execution | **HIGH-HEAT** (critical) |

High-heat architecture layers: local dev HTTP servers and shared `cli-kit` helpers map directly to Phase 3 DFD slices.

### Bug Type Recurrence

| Bug class | CWEs | Count | Examples | Recurrence |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Path traversal / arbitrary file read | CWE-22, CWE-61, CWE-200 | 4 | LiquidJS symlink/root bypass; LiquidJS `renderFile/parseFile` arbitrary read; Vite source-map traversal; Vite WebSocket file read | **Recurring** |
| DoS / resource exhaustion | CWE-400, CWE-674 | 2 | LiquidJS circular layout; LiquidJS `replace` amplification | **Recurring** |
| Command/code injection | CWE-78, CWE-94 | 2 | Windows `treeKill`; lodash `_.template` imports-key code injection | **Recurring** |
| Auth bypass / broken auth | CWE-287, CWE-306 | 2 | GraphiQL random-key hardening; Vite WS no-auth file-read advisory | **Recurring** |
| Info disclosure / cross-origin data exposure | CWE-200, CWE-942, CWE-346 | 3 | Theme dev CORS; LiquidJS sort side-channel; Vite file reads | **Recurring** |
| XSS / script injection | CWE-79 | 1 | GraphiQL config JSON embedded in `<script>` | Single but high-impact in local dev browser context |
| Prototype pollution | CWE-1321 | 1 direct; multiple transitive | lodash `unset/omit`; transitive `defu`, `flatted`, `immutable` | Recurs in dependency graph |
| Glob/parser ReDoS | CWE-400 class | Multiple transitive | `minimatch`, `picomatch`, `brace-expansion` | Recurs in lockfile |

### Attack Surface Trends

1. **Browser-origin to localhost dev servers** — Theme dev CORS, GraphiQL auth/XSS, Vite WS/file-read advisories all point to risk when a malicious website can reach `localhost`, a bound dev-host interface, or a tunnel URL.
2. **Filesystem/template/config parsing** — Liquid templates, generated extension templates, TOML/YAML app/theme config, glob patterns, and theme files are recurrent parser inputs.
3. **CLI arguments, env vars, and process execution** — `treeKill`, `execa`, `execCommand`, `SHOPIFY_CLI_CLOUDFLARED_PATH`, global proxy env variables, and external tool invocation are privileged local-machine boundaries.
4. **Network proxying and token-bearing HTTP** — Shopify Admin/Partners/Identity GraphQL/REST, storefront renderer proxying, `follow-redirects`, `undici`, and custom header forwarding can expose tokens or local services if redirect/CORS/header filtering is incomplete.
5. **OAuth/session persistence** — Store auth PKCE local callback, device auth/session store, and token refresh flows repeatedly cross browser/local/Shopify platform boundaries.

### Patch Quality Signals

| Structural recurrence candidate | Evidence | Patch-bypass hypothesis |
|---|---|---|
| GraphiQL/local dev browser interface | 2023 random-key auth hardening + 2025 script-context XSS branch + permissive CORS/ping/status support in current server | Review every GraphiQL route and generated HTML for key enforcement, origin policy, script-context escaping, forwarded headers, and token leakage. |
| Localhost dev servers as a class | Theme dev CORS fix + GraphiQL fixes + Vite dev-server advisories | Apply a common local-server policy: bind to loopback by default, deny wildcard CORS on sensitive routes, require unguessable keys for token-bearing APIs, and test malicious-browser requests. |
| Template rendering and scaffolding | 5 LiquidJS advisories plus `recursiveLiquidTemplateCopy` over downloaded/generated template directories | Update `liquidjs` and test symlink/include/render/path traversal and DoS payloads in app init/generate and extension-template flows. |
| Process execution cleanup | Critical `treeKill` fix exists on non-main branches while current HEAD still shows pre-fix shell execution | Verify merge status and all process-kill call sites; ensure no shell invocation receives strings derived from args/env/PIDs. |
| Object-path operations | lodash prototype pollution advisory and codebase wrappers `getPathValue/setPathValue/unsetPathValue` | Audit paths sourced from extension specifications, remote config, TOML, GraphQL, or user input for `__proto__`/constructor/prototype pollution. |

## Architecture Inventory

### Components

- **`@shopify/cli`**: oclif entrypoint/command registry; wires app, theme, store, Hydrogen, oclif plugin commands, and global proxy support.
- **`@shopify/cli-kit`**: shared platform layer for auth/session storage, GraphQL/REST requests, filesystem/path helpers, Liquid rendering, process execution, local config/conf store, UI, telemetry, and error handling.
- **`@shopify/app`**: app init/generate/build/deploy/dev; extension templates; app dev process supervisor; local GraphiQL server; dev proxy/tunnel integration; TOML config transforms.
- **`@shopify/theme`**: theme commands; theme dev local h3 server; hot reload; local/remote file sync; storefront renderer/CDN proxy; theme check; package/push/pull.
- **`@shopify/store`**: store auth PKCE flow, local callback listener, persisted app sessions, Admin GraphQL execute command.
- **`@shopify/plugin-cloudflare`**: downloads and executes `cloudflared`; provides tunnel provider/start hooks.
- **UI extension packages**: dev console React app/server-kit, Vite-built assets, test utilities.
- **Workspace/release tooling**: Nx, Changesets, release scripts, docs/schema generation, GitHub automation scripts.

### Transports and data paths

- CLI args, flags, stdin, environment variables, local config files, generated templates, and project directories.
- Local HTTP servers on `localhost` / configured host: GraphiQL, theme dev server, OAuth callback, hot reload/WebSocket-like flows.
- HTTPS/GraphQL/REST to Shopify Admin, Partners, Identity, storefront renderer, GitHub template repositories, and Cloudflare release downloads.
- Cloudflare tunnels and browser-open flows, including preview and GraphiQL URLs.
- Child processes and external tools via `execa`, `spawn`, `execCommand`, `open`, `taskkill`, `tar`, `cloudflared`, package managers, build tools.

### Trust boundaries

- **Internet/browser → local developer machine**: malicious websites, preview/tunnel users, or browser pages reaching local dev endpoints.
- **User project/template repo → CLI process**: untrusted app/theme/extension templates, TOML/YAML/JSON, Liquid, globs, symlinks, and generated files.
- **CLI process → Shopify platform**: token-bearing GraphQL/REST requests, token refresh, Admin/Partners/Storefront APIs.
- **CLI process → external binaries/plugins**: cloudflared, package managers, esbuild/native modules, ast-grep native package.
- **CI/release automation → repository/package publishing**: Changesets, Nx, GitHub scripts, Homebrew/release tooling.

### Highest-risk flows for Phase 3 DFD/CFD

1. `shopify app dev`: app config/TOML → dev process setup → tunnel/proxy → GraphiQL local server → Admin API token use.
2. `shopify theme dev`: theme filesystem watcher → local h3 server → storefront renderer/CDN proxy → browser origins/CORS/cookies.
3. App/extension generation: remote or selected template repo → Liquid rendering / file copy → local project filesystem.
4. Store auth/execute: browser PKCE flow → loopback callback → token persistence → Admin GraphQL execution from stdin/file/CLI args.
5. Process and plugin lifecycle: tunnel install/start/kill, child-process cleanup, env-controlled binary paths and proxy settings.

## Dependency Intelligence

### Manifest and lockfile overview

- Package manager: `pnpm@10.11.1`.
- Workspace packages: 14 named package manifests plus root workspace.
- Unique direct dependency names across manifests: 161.
- Versioned OSV direct-dependency checks: 156 package/version queries; 3 vulnerable direct packages; 9 advisory hits.
- Versioned OSV lockfile checks: 1,903 package/version queries in chunks; 22 vulnerable package-version entries; 38 package-version advisory hits; 29 unique GHSA IDs.

### Current direct dependency advisories requiring triage

| Dependency | Current use | Advisories | Immediate dependency action | Reachability questions |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `liquidjs@10.25.0` | Root dev dep and `@shopify/cli-kit` runtime dependency for `renderLiquidTemplate` / `recursiveLiquidTemplateCopy` | 5 GHSA: file read/path traversal/info disclosure/DoS | Upgrade to at least `10.25.7` to cover all listed LiquidJS fixes. | Can attacker-controlled templates use `include/render/layout`, symlinks, or deep/circular constructs during app init/generate/extension template rendering? |
| `lodash@4.17.23` | `@shopify/cli-kit` runtime common helpers, including object path wrappers | Code injection in `_.template`, prototype pollution in `_.unset/omit` | Upgrade to `4.18.0` when available/compatible; meanwhile constrain path inputs. | Are `setPathValue/getPathValue/unsetPathValue` paths ever sourced from remote extension specs, TOML, GraphQL, or user-controlled arrays containing `__proto__`/constructor? |
| `vite@6.4.1` | UI extensions dev console/server-kit dev/build tooling | WebSocket arbitrary file read; optimized deps map path traversal | Upgrade to `6.4.2` (or newer) in affected workspaces. | Is any Vite dev server bound beyond loopback during development/CI, or reachable from untrusted browsers? |

Dependency findings are exploit hypotheses until a reachable path is shown. The clusters most relevant to Shopify CLI's architecture are: `protobufjs` via telemetry, `defu/h3` in local servers, `follow-redirects/undici` in network clients/proxies, `yaml/smol-toml/@iarna/toml/@shopify/toml-patch` in config parsing, and glob/ReDoS packages around project/theme filesystem traversal.

### Supply-chain risk notes

- Current HEAD does not contain a `SECURITY.md` file; security reporting may rely on GitHub advisories or Shopify external processes. Confirm intended disclosure path.
- `@shopify/plugin-cloudflare` downloads a fixed `cloudflared` release from GitHub and installs/executes it; no checksum/signature validation was observed in the inspected installer. `SHOPIFY_CLI_CLOUDFLARED_PATH` can redirect execution to an env-provided path.
- Native/binary dependencies with elevated supply-chain impact: `@ast-grep/napi`, `esbuild`, `node-pty` (e2e), `@parcel/watcher`, and `@shopify/toml-patch` (WASM).
- High-risk parsers and validators: LiquidJS, TOML/YAML parsers, JSON schema refs/AJV, GraphQL parsers, glob/micromatch/minimatch, PostCSS/Vite.
- `gh` was required by the supply-chain-risk-auditor skill for exact GitHub dependency health metrics, but the local gh credential is invalid; dependency health checks requiring GitHub stars/issues were therefore not completed in this phase.

## Patch Commit Discovery Notes

- Local security diffs were captured under `piolium/tmp/local-security-diffs/`.
- Theme CORS patch `226b49e740`: changed `handleCors(origin: '*')` to an origin allowlist and removed proxied CORS response headers.
- GraphiQL auth patch series `adba3d9bb7/fa3266ea42/306c0f6d37`: added random key to GraphiQL URL/API calls and baseline-like 404 for failed key.
- GraphiQL XSS patch `7719dd5af5`: escaped script-breaking JSON characters before embedding config in HTML. This commit is on a non-main remote branch, so use as pattern intelligence.
- treeKill patches `f4de6ef1ab/0b38241657`: strict PID regex and `spawn('taskkill', args)`; not ancestors of current HEAD, while current source still shows pre-fix shell execution.

## Audit Targeting Recommendations

> Based on pattern analysis: Phase 3 should prioritize **app dev GraphiQL**, **theme dev proxy/hot reload**, **cli-kit Liquid/template rendering**, **store auth callback/token execution**, and **process/tunnel lifecycle** for DFD slices. Phase 5 deep probe should target **browser-origin-to-localhost**, **file/template path traversal and symlink handling**, **CLI/env/process execution**, and **token-bearing HTTP proxy/header flows**. Phase 8 chambers should include **command injection**, **path traversal/arbitrary file read**, **XSS/script-context injection**, **CORS/broken auth**, **prototype pollution/object-path abuse**, and **ReDoS/resource exhaustion** as mandatory attack modes. Patch-bypass-checker should flag **GraphiQL/local dev server**, **LiquidJS/template rendering**, and **treeKill/process cleanup** as structural-recurrence candidates.
