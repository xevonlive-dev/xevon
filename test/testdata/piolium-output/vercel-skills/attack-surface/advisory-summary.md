#### Historical coverage metadata

- **Tier reached:** Tier 2 (all-time). Tier 1 recent first-party/package advisories were below the 15-advisory signal threshold; collection expanded to all-time and dependency/ecosystem advisories for pattern coverage.
- **Total advisories/signals collected:** 18 total in the table: 1 first-party non-indexed issue, 17 dependency advisories. Recent 2yr: 13. Older: 5.
- **Exact target package/repo advisories:** 0 structured advisories from OSV (`npm/skills`), GitHub repo security advisories, GitHub advisory `affects=skills`, and NVD exact `vercel-labs skills`/`npm skills` all-time queries.
- **Severity distribution:** CRITICAL: 3, HIGH: 11, MEDIUM: 4, LOW: 0. Medium coverage is represented; no low-severity advisories were found for exact target or relevant dependencies.
- **Repository identity:** `vercel-labs/skills` resolved via git remote (`origin`). `OWNER=vercel-labs`, `REPO=skills`.
- **Git history available:** true (per `PIGOLIUM_GIT_AVAILABLE` default and `git rev-parse` actual check).
- **Coverage gaps recorded:**
  - Source 2 primary `gh api` GitHub Security Advisory GraphQL/REST attempts failed with HTTP 401 `Bad credentials`; unauthenticated curl fallback found 0 repo advisories and 0 `affects=skills` advisories, but this is not full `gh api` coverage.
  - NVD two-year date-window query returned HTTP 404 (public API date-window restriction); all-time exact and generic keyword queries were used instead. Generic `keywordSearch=skills` returned 15 unrelated skill/AI-skill advisories and was excluded from the target inventory.
  - Patch-commit discovery for first-party CVE/GHSA advisories was not applicable because there are no indexed first-party CVE/GHSA records. For non-indexed issue #353, PR #356 is open/unmerged; no local merged patch commit exists. Dependency patch commits were captured from OSV references where available.
- **Raw evidence retained:** `piolium/attack-surface/raw/` contains local grep, OSV, NVD, pnpm audit/outdated/why, npm metadata, GitHub issue/PR fallback, and patch-reference artifacts.

### Vulnerability Pattern Analysis

#### Component Vulnerability Heatmap

| Rank | Component / module | Count | Severity distribution | Dominant bug types | Phase priority |
|---:|---|---:|---|---|---|
| 1 | `simple-git` / `src/git.ts` clone boundary | 6 | 1 Critical, 5 High | Command/argument injection, git option parsing bypass, RCE | **HIGH-HEAT**: runtime-bundled dependency mediates user-supplied repository URLs/refs. |
| 2 | Vite/Vitest/Rollup/PostCSS dev/build stack | 6 | 2 Critical, 2 High, 2 Medium | Dev-server file read/RCE, build path traversal/write, XSS in generated output | **HIGH-HEAT**: mostly CI/dev, but severe if dev servers/build inputs are exposed or attacker-controlled. |
| 3 | Skill discovery/install naming (`src/skills.ts`, `src/installer.ts`) | 1 first-party signal | 1 High | Namespace squatting, duplicate-name shadowing, untrusted content selection | **HIGH-HEAT by impact**: project-specific supply-chain installation path. |
| 4 | Glob/config parser stack (`picomatch`, `defu`, lock/build config) | 3 | 2 High, 1 Medium | ReDoS, method/prototype pollution | **HIGH-HEAT**: parser/config bugs recur in build and discovery helpers. |
| 5 | YAML frontmatter parser (`src/frontmatter.ts`, `src/skills.ts`) | 2 | 1 High, 1 Medium | Parser crash/DoS, stack overflow | Watch: runtime parser for untrusted remote `SKILL.md` metadata. |

#### Bug Type Recurrence

| Bug class | CWEs | Count | Examples | Phase 8 priority |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Command injection / RCE | CWE-78, CWE-88, CWE-94, CWE-1385 | 7 | simple-git CVE-2022-24433/24066/25912/25860/2026-28291/28292; Vitest CVE-2025-24964 | **Mandatory** |

#### Attack Surface Trends

1. **Untrusted git/source input -> native git subprocess:** `skills add <source>` accepts GitHub/GitLab shorthand, arbitrary git URLs, refs, and subpaths; `src/git.ts` delegates clone to bundled `simple-git`.
2. **Remote/local skill metadata parsing -> install decisions:** `SKILL.md` YAML frontmatter controls display name, description, filtering, dedupe, and installation directory naming.
3. **Filesystem installation boundary:** canonical `.agents/skills/<name>` and global agent directories are created, removed, copied, or symlinked based on untrusted skill metadata after sanitization.
4. **Dev/build server/tooling exposure:** Vite/Vitest advisories repeatedly exploit localhost/dev-server assumptions; relevant to CI, maintainers, and any exposed test API server.
5. **Config/glob/parser input:** plugin manifests, node_modules sync, YAML, and glob/build tools are recurring parser/config trust boundaries.
6. **AI-skill ecosystem analogs:** NVD generic `skills` search surfaced unrelated OpenClaw skill path traversal/archive-packaging CVEs; not target advisories, but they reinforce path-containment and archive/symlink review priorities for this class of tool.

#### Patch Quality Signals

- **Structural recurrence: `simple-git` command execution boundary.** Multiple 2022 and 2026 command-injection/RCE fixes show repeated bypasses in the same conceptual boundary. Do not rely only on library blocking; Phase 2/5 should validate local URL/ref allowlisting and fixed argv construction around `cloneRepo()`.
- **Structural recurrence: Vite dev-server `server.fs.deny`.** Vite has a long series of file-read bypasses; treat any local dev/test server exposure as high risk, even though it is not a production runtime component.
- **Structural recurrence: skill discovery name binding.** PR #356 proposes rejecting name-directory mismatches and duplicate names, but it remains unmerged. Current code still uses frontmatter name for dedupe/install naming.
- **Parser/resource guardrail gap:** YAML and glob advisories suggest adding size/depth/time limits for `SKILL.md`, plugin manifests, and repository discovery where practical.

#### Audit targeting recommendations

> Based on pattern analysis: Phase 3 should prioritize DFD slices for `skills add` remote-source ingestion, `cloneRepo()`/simple-git subprocess invocation, skill discovery/deduplication, and filesystem install/symlink flows. Phase 5 deep probe should target untrusted repository URLs/refs/subpaths, malicious `SKILL.md` frontmatter, duplicate skill names, symlink/copy path containment, and node_modules/well-known sync inputs. Phase 8 chambers should include command injection, path traversal/arbitrary write, parser DoS, prototype pollution, and namespace-confusion attack modes. Patch-bypass-checker should flag `simple-git` usage and skill discovery name binding as `structural-recurrence` candidates.

### Architecture Inventory

- **Components:** Node.js CLI (`bin/cli.mjs`, `src/cli.ts`); command handlers (`add`, `list`, `find`, `remove`, `update`, `init`, `experimental_install`, `experimental_sync`); source parser; git clone wrapper; blob/GitHub tree downloader; skill discovery/frontmatter parser; plugin manifest parser; installer/remover; global/project lockfiles; telemetry/audit client.
- **Transports:** CLI args/stdin prompts; native `git` subprocess via `simple-git`; HTTPS fetch to GitHub API/raw content, `skills.sh` download API, and `add-skill.vercel.sh` telemetry/audit; local filesystem copy/symlink/rm; JSON/YAML files; GitHub Actions CI/publish workflows.
- **Trust boundaries:** public internet repositories and well-known endpoints -> local developer machine; remote skill metadata -> agent-readable skill directories; project-local `.agents/skills` vs global home/config agent dirs; CI build/publish environment; telemetry/audit external service response -> terminal output; npm dependency/build supply chain -> published CLI bundle.
- **Execution environments:** Node >=18 on developer machines; GitHub Actions Linux/Windows CI; npm package bundle built by `obuild`; optional global installs under home/XDG config paths.
- **Highest-risk flows:**
  1. `skills add <source>` -> `parseSource()` -> blob/GitHub tree fetch or `cloneRepo()` -> `discoverSkills()` -> `parseFrontmatter()` -> `installSkillForAgent()`.
  2. `cloneRepo(url, ref)` -> simple-git/native git with user-controlled URL/ref and environment inherited from the user.
  3. Well-known HTTP source -> remote JSON/SKILL content -> install without repository history.
  4. `experimental_sync` -> scan `node_modules` packages for `SKILL.md` -> install into agent directories.
  5. Remove/update flows -> lockfile state -> recursive filesystem deletion/copy/symlink operations.

### Dependency Intelligence

- **Active lockfile advisories:** `pnpm audit` reported 12 active installed advisories: 1 critical, 7 high, 4 moderate by npm severity across `simple-git`, `rollup`, `vite`, `picomatch`, `defu`, and `postcss`.
- **Runtime-bundled dependency concern:** `simple-git` is declared as a devDependency but bundled into `dist/cli.mjs` and used at runtime for cloning. Current lock `3.30.0` is affected by CVE-2026-28291 and CVE-2026-28292. Upgrade to `>=3.32.3` (prefer latest `3.36.0`) and harden local URL/ref validation.
- **Runtime parser:** `yaml@2.8.3` is current and fixed for CVE-2026-33532, but it parses untrusted `SKILL.md` frontmatter. Maintain file-size/depth limits and fail-closed parse behavior.
- **Build/test stack:** `obuild@0.4.22`, `vitest@4.0.18`, Vite/Rollup/PostCSS transitive versions are behind fixed releases. CI/dev risk rises if tests/dev servers or build inputs are attacker-controlled.
- **Config/glob stack:** `picomatch` and `defu` active advisories map to glob/config parser abuse. Any future feature accepting user-supplied globs/config should be threat-modeled.
- **Outdated direct dependencies:** `@clack/prompts`, `obuild`, `simple-git`, `vitest`, `lint-staged`, `prettier`, type packages have newer releases. Security-relevant upgrades: `simple-git >=3.32.3`, `obuild` latest, `vitest` latest, `vite >=7.3.2/8.0.5`, `rollup >=4.59.0`, `picomatch >=4.0.4` and `>=2.3.2`, `defu >=6.1.5`, `postcss >=8.5.10`.
- **Supply-chain-risk-auditor delegation:** supply-chain-risk-auditor methodology was loaded and the existing `.supply-chain-risk-auditor/results.md` was incorporated. Its GitHub repo-stat scan was limited by the same `gh api` 401 credential issue; npm metadata, pnpm audit, OSV, and NVD enrichment were used instead.
