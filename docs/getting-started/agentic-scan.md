# Agentic Scan

The **agentic scan** is xevon's AI-driven scanning mode. Where the
[native scan](native-scan.md) runs a deterministic, Go-based pipeline of
scanner modules, the agentic scan hands the wheel (or part of it) to an LLM
that reasons about the target, decides what to test, drives tools, and
reports findings as it confirms them.

This page is the quickest path from a fresh install to your first AI-driven
scan. For source-code review and whitebox audits, see
[Agentic Security Audit](agentic-security-audit.md).

## What you get

Two agentic-scan modes ship under `xevon agent`:

| Mode | One-line | Best for |
|---|---|---|
| `autopilot` | One long LLM session with shell, file, and HTTP tools | Free-form pentest-style exploration |
| `swarm` | LLM plans → native scanner executes → optional triage | Structured, repeatable scans of a known target |

Both write findings to the same database used by the native scan, so the
usual `xevon finding list` / `/api/findings` surfaces work unchanged.

## Prerequisites

Agentic scans need exactly one configured LLM provider. The full provider
matrix and BYOK auth options live in
[Setting Up the Agent](setup-agent.md) — the short version:

```bash
# Cheapest path if you already have a ChatGPT Plus/Pro/Team sub.
codex login
xevon config set agent.olium.provider openai-codex-oauth

# Sanity check — should print a model name.
xevon ol -p 'what model are you running'
```

Anything that returns a model name from `xevon ol -p` is wired correctly
— `autopilot` and `swarm` will reuse the same provider.

## 1. Autopilot — hand the agent a target

`autopilot` is the simplest agentic mode: one LLM session with shell, file,
and HTTP access. It picks its own strategy and stops when it has nothing
productive left to do.

```bash
# Plain URL target.
xevon agent autopilot -t https://example.com

# A specific request — paste a curl, raw HTTP, or Burp XML; auto-detected.
xevon agent autopilot --input "curl -X POST -d 'q=test' https://example.com/api"

# Cap cost / time on CI-style runs.
xevon agent autopilot -t https://example.com --intensity quick --max-duration 5m
```

The `--intensity` preset (`quick` / `balanced` / `deep`) tunes turn count,
duration limits, and how aggressively the agent explores.

## 2. Swarm — let the AI direct the native scanner

`swarm` keeps the AI in the planning seat and the native Go scanner in the
execution seat. The agent picks modules, optionally writes custom JS
extensions, the deterministic pipeline runs, and an optional triage pass
verifies findings.

```bash
# Targeted scan of a single request the LLM decides how to attack.
xevon agent swarm -t https://example.com/api/users?id=1

# Full-scope scan — AI plans, native discovery + scanning execute.
xevon agent swarm -t https://example.com --discover --triage
```

Useful flags:

- `--discover` — run native content discovery before scanning.
- `--triage` — AI reviews each finding to suppress false positives.
- `--vuln-type sqli` — focus on one bug class.
- `-m xss -m sqli` — restrict to specific scanner modules.

## 3. Add source code for a deeper read

If you have the codebase, point `--source` at it. Both modes pick up
filesystem read/write access and the agent can correlate code with traffic.

```bash
xevon agent autopilot -t https://example.com --source ~/src/your-app
xevon agent swarm -t https://example.com --source ~/src/your-app --code-audit --triage
```

Source code unlocks the dedicated audit pipeline — for the full whitebox
flow, see [Agentic Security Audit](agentic-security-audit.md).

## Choosing between autopilot and swarm

| You want... | Use |
|---|---|
| Creative, exploratory testing — let the agent improvise | `autopilot` |
| Structured, repeatable scans with optional verification | `swarm` |
| Source-aware code review alongside scanning | either, with `--source` |
| A single request hit hard from many angles | `swarm` with `--input` |
| Full-scope crawl + scan with AI planning | `swarm --discover --triage` |

## Where results go

Findings stream to the console and persist to the same SQLite database the
native scan uses:

```bash
xevon finding list                           # all findings
xevon finding list --agent-mode autopilot    # filter by agent mode
xevon agent session list                     # past runs
```

Each run also writes a session directory under
`~/.xevon/agent-sessions/<uuid>/` containing `runtime.log`, generated
extensions, and the raw agent output — handy when a scan looked off and you
want to read the agent's reasoning.

## REST API

If you'd rather drive scans from your own controller, the same modes are
exposed over HTTP:

```bash
xevon server &

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9002/api/agent/run/autopilot \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"target": "https://example.com"}'

curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9002/api/agent/run/swarm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"input": "https://example.com", "discover": true, "triage": true}'
```

Each call returns `202 Accepted` with an `agentic_scan_uuid`; poll
`/api/agent/status/:id` and pull session artifacts from
`/api/agent/sessions/:id/...` when it finishes.
