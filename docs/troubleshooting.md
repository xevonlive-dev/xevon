# Troubleshooting

Common issues encountered when using xevon and their solutions.

## WAF/Rate Limiting Blocking Scans

**Symptoms:** Many requests return 403/429 status codes, scan results are incomplete, or the target becomes unresponsive.

**Solutions:**

Reduce concurrency to slow down request volume:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com -c 10
```

Apply a rate limit (requests per second):

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com -r 50
```

Use the lite strategy, which uses fewer payloads and a less aggressive scanning profile:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --strategy lite
```

You can combine these options for heavily protected targets:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --strategy lite -c 5 -r 20
```

## Browser Not Found (Spidering)

**Symptoms:** Spidering phase fails with errors about missing Chromium or browser binary.

**Solutions:**

Chromium is automatically downloaded on first use to `~/.cache/spitolas/chromium-<version>/`. If this download is blocked by network restrictions:

1. Use `make deps-chrome` to build with an embedded Chromium binary.
2. Alternatively, skip the spidering phase entirely:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --skip spidering
```

## Scope Mismatch (No Results)

**Symptoms:** Scan completes but produces zero findings or skips all requests.

**Solutions:**

Verify the target URL matches the configured scope. The scanner only tests URLs that fall within the defined scope.

Check the current scope configuration:

```bash
xevon project config
```

Explicitly set the scope to include your target by updating the config:

```bash
xevon config set scope.host.include "*.example.com"
```

Ensure the target URL scheme (http vs https) and hostname match what the scope expects. Subdomains are not included by default unless a wildcard pattern is used.

## OAST Not Working

**Symptoms:** No out-of-band findings are reported, even for vulnerabilities that typically produce OAST interactions (e.g., blind SSRF, blind XXE).

**Solutions:**

OAST requires outbound DNS and HTTP connectivity from the target application to the OAST callback server. Check that:

1. The scanned application can make outbound DNS queries.
2. The scanned application can make outbound HTTP requests.
3. No firewall rules block these outbound connections.

OAST is optional. The scanner still produces findings without it using in-band detection methods. OAST adds an extra layer of detection for blind/out-of-band vulnerabilities, but its absence does not prevent the scanner from working.

## High Memory Usage on Large Targets

**Symptoms:** The scanner process consumes excessive memory, the system becomes slow, or the process is killed by the OS.

**Solutions:**

Use the lite strategy to reduce the number of payloads and checks:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --strategy lite
```

Run only the dynamic-assessment phase to skip discovery and spidering, which can generate large numbers of URLs:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --only dynamic-assessment
```

Reduce concurrency to limit the number of in-flight requests and queued items:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com -c 5
```

Skip discovery to avoid large wordlist-based scans that produce many URLs:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --skip discovery
```

## Scan Takes Too Long

**Symptoms:** Scan runs for hours without completing, or appears stuck in a particular phase.

**Solutions:**

Use the lite strategy for faster scans with fewer checks:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --strategy lite
```

Limit discovery time to prevent long-running content discovery:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --discover-max-time 5m
```

Limit spidering time:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --spider-max-time 5m
```

Run only the dynamic-assessment phase if you already have traffic recorded:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --only dynamic-assessment
```

Combine options for the fastest possible scan:

```bash
xevon scan -t https://example.com --strategy lite --skip discovery --skip spidering
```

## Database Issues

**Symptoms:** Errors related to database access, corrupted data, or migration failures.

**Solutions:**

The default database is SQLite, stored at `~/.xevon/xevon.db`.

To switch to a different database location:

```bash
xevon scan --target https://example.com --db /path/to/other.db
```

To reset the database and start fresh:

```bash
xevon db clean
```

For production deployments, consider using PostgreSQL instead of SQLite. Configure the database connection in `xevon-configs.yaml` or via the `--db` flag with a PostgreSQL connection string.

## Agent Mode Not Working

**Symptoms:** `xevon agent` commands fail with errors about missing backends, connection issues, or authentication failures.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check backend configuration.** Agent backends are configured in the `agent` section of `xevon-configs.yaml`. The default backend (`claude`) uses the SDK protocol and requires the `claude` CLI in PATH:

```yaml
agent:
  default_agent: claude
  backends:
    claude:
      command: claude
      protocol: sdk
```

2. **Ensure the coding agent CLI is installed.** The default `claude` backend requires the Claude Code CLI. Other backends require their respective CLIs:

```bash
# Verify Claude CLI is available
claude --version
```

3. **Check API keys.** Ensure the required API keys are set as environment variables (e.g., `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` for Claude, `OPENAI_API_KEY` for Codex).

4. **Verify session directory permissions.** Agent sessions are stored under `~/.xevon/agent-sessions/` by default (configurable via `agent.sessions_dir` in `xevon-configs.yaml`). Ensure this directory is writable.

## Permission Denied on Build

**Symptoms:** `make build` or `make install` fails with permission errors when writing to `$GOPATH/bin`.

**Solutions:**

Ensure `$GOPATH/bin` exists and is writable:

```bash
mkdir -p "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
chmod u+w "$(go env GOPATH)/bin"
```

Always use `make build` instead of `go build`. Direct `go build` bypasses version injection and may produce incorrect binaries:

```bash
# Correct
make build

# Incorrect - do not use
go build -o xevon .
```

The `make build` command outputs the binary to `bin/xevon` and installs it to `$GOPATH/bin`. If you only need the binary locally without installation, the built binary is available at `bin/xevon` after running `make build`.
