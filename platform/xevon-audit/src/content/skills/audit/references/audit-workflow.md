## Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering

**Subagent**: `cve-scout`

**Goal**: Build a complete inventory of published security advisories, architecture context, and security-relevant dependency intelligence.

**Advisory source priority**:
1. Project-hosted advisory page (check README, SECURITY.md, or project website)
2. GitHub Security Advisories (`gh api graphql` or `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/security-advisories`)
3. NVD/CVE database (web search for `site:nvd.nist.gov <project-name>`)
4. OSV database (`https://osv.dev/list?q=<package-name>`)
5. Release notes / changelog (grep for `CVE`, `security`, `vulnerability`)

**Architecture inventory**:
- Identify components, processes, services, plugins, workers, control planes, and external dependencies.
- Identify transports and protocols: HTTP, gRPC, WebSocket, queues, files, CLI, IPC, schedulers, plugins, agent/tool invocation, and any custom RPC layer.
- Identify trust boundaries and execution environments: internet-facing, internal-only, desktop-local, CI/CD, control-plane vs data-plane, tenant vs admin.
- Record the handful of highest-risk flows that deserve Phase 3 DFD/CFD slices.

**Dependency intelligence**:
- Inspect manifests, lockfiles, build files, container files, and deployment config.
- Note outdated, unsupported, or historically bug-prone dependencies that influence parsing, auth, serialization, policy enforcement, code execution, or network handling.
- **Action**: Delegate to the `supply-chain-risk-auditor` skill to perform a comprehensive dependency analysis.
- Treat dependency findings as exploit hypotheses unless a reachable abuse path is established later in the audit.

**When only a patched version is known** (no direct commit reference):

```bash
# Find commits between vulnerable and patched tags
git log --oneline v<vulnerable>..v<patched>

# Narrow to security-relevant files
git log --oneline v<vulnerable>..v<patched> -- src/xevon-results/ src/auth/ src/validation/

# Diff the full range
git diff v<vulnerable>..v<patched> -- <relevant-paths>
```

**Output**: `## Advisory Intelligence` section of `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`, populated with advisory inventory, architecture intelligence, vulnerability class patterns, and supply chain risk summary.

---

## Phase 2: Patch Bypass Analysis

**Subagent**: `patch-auditor` (one instance per patch)

**Goal**: Determine whether each security patch is sound, bypassable, or relocated.

**Invocation**: spawn one `patch-auditor` instance per patch commit. Each instance receives:
- The patch diff (`git show <commit>`)
- The advisory metadata (CVE/GHSA ID, severity, description)
- The repository path

**Parallelism**: multiple patch-auditor instances can run in parallel since they are read-only.

**Output**: `## Bypass Analysis` section of `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`

---

## Phase 3: Knowledge Base

**Subagent**: `threat-modeler`

**Goal**: Understand the system deeply enough to guide all subsequent phases.

**Key questions to answer**:
- What type of project is this? (See [Architecture and Project Attack Pattern Catalog](#architecture-and-project-attack-pattern-catalog))
- What are the major components and trust boundaries?
- How do data and control move between components?
- Where are the security-critical decisions made?
- Which paths cross trust boundaries, change execution context, or propagate identity?
- What does it protect? (Assets)
- Who can attack it? (Threat actors)
- Where does attacker input enter? (Attack surface)
- What specs/RFCs does it implement? (For Phase 9)

**Required outputs inside the existing reports**:
- A compact architecture inventory.
- DFD slices for only the highest-risk attacker-controlled flows.
- CFD slices for only the highest-risk authn/authz, policy, routing, orchestration, or privilege-transition paths.
- A list of components, wrappers, generated interfaces, and unusual trust boundaries that likely require custom Phase 4 modeling.
- **Action**: Invoke the `security-threat-model` skill to formally document and capture these elements.

**Domain Attack Research (Mode A/B/C)**:

After architecture mapping and spec identification, run domain attack research:

- **Mode A -- Library-as-target**: project type is `library`, `plugin`, or `protocol`. Delegate to
  `sharp-edges` (API footguns), `wooyun-legacy` (web-facing libraries only), and `last30days`
  (recent CVE discussions for the library by name).

- **Mode B -- Library-as-consumer**: security-sensitive dependencies identified in Phase 1 or
  Step 2. Delegate to `sharp-edges` (consumer usage), `insecure-defaults` (fail-open configs), and
  `last30days` (per dependency for recent misuse disclosures).

- **Mode C -- Domain-specific**: triggered when technology domains are detected (SAML, OAuth, JWT,
  HTTP, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket, XML/SOAP, TLS, DNS, SMTP, LDAP, SSH, serialization,
  compression, crypto). For each domain, run the research action sequence from
  `references/domain-attack-playbooks.md`: web search, `last30days`, `wooyun-legacy` (conditional),
  MCP tools (best-effort). Produce a domain attack taxonomy, custom SAST targets, and manual review
  checklist per domain.

All three modes are non-exclusive. Run Mode C alongside Mode A/B whenever domains are detected.
Write results to the `## Domain Attack Research` section of `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`.

**Output**: `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md` with all Phase 3 sections populated (Project Classification, Architecture, Trust Boundaries, DFD/CFD Slices, Threat Model, Attack Surface, Domain Attack Research, Specs/RFCs, Dependencies, Phase 4 Modeling Targets)

---

## Phase 4: Static Analysis — Resource Management

**Subagent**: `code-scanner`

**Execution order is mandatory**:
1. Run built-in CodeQL suites appropriate to the repo languages via the `codeql` skill.
2. Run built-in Semgrep baseline, language, and framework rulesets via the `semgrep` skill.
3. Check GitHub Actions workflows using the `agentic-actions-auditor` skill.
4. Add custom CodeQL and Semgrep coverage only where the Phase 3 DFD/CFD slices show blind spots, wrappers, or unusual trust boundaries.
5. If multiple SARIF outputs are produced, use `sarif-parsing` to deduplicate.

### Concurrency Management

CodeQL and Semgrep are resource-intensive. Check before spawning:

```bash
# Count running SAST processes
SAST_COUNT=$(ps aux | grep -E 'codeql|semgrep' | grep -v grep | wc -l)
echo "Running SAST processes: $SAST_COUNT"

# Only proceed if count < 2
if [ "$SAST_COUNT" -ge 2 ]; then
  echo "Too many SAST processes running. Wait before starting."
  exit 1
fi
```

### Disk Space Check

CodeQL databases can be large (1-10 GB for large repos). Check before building:

```bash
# Check available disk space
df -h .

# Estimate repo size
du -sh <target-repo>
```

As a rough guide: the CodeQL database is typically 2-5x the size of the source code.

### Language Detection

```bash
# Detect primary languages
find <target> -type f | sed 's/.*\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -20

# Or use github-linguist if available
github-linguist <target>
```

### Architecture-Specific Modeling Decision

Custom modeling is mandatory when one or more of these are true:
- security-critical data crosses multiple components or transports
- identity or policy decisions propagate across service boundaries
- the codebase relies on custom wrappers around frameworks, RPC, auth, parsing, storage, or execution
- generated interfaces, IDLs, schemas, plugins, or orchestration layers hide sources, summaries, or sinks from built-in tooling
- the highest-risk Phase 3 DFD/CFD slices do not map cleanly onto built-in sources, sinks, or enforcement checks

When custom modeling is required:
- store CodeQL artifacts under `xevon-results/codeql-queries/`
- store Semgrep artifacts under `xevon-results/semgrep-rules/`
- cite which DFD/CFD slices motivated each custom model or rule
- open the exact build references in [architecture-aware-sast.md](architecture-aware-sast.md) before writing custom queries or rules

See [architecture-aware-sast.md](architecture-aware-sast.md) for the modeling workflow.

### Semgrep Execution Policy

Semgrep Pro is mandatory when available, but do not run all Pro-heavy rulesets simultaneously on large repos.

Use this execution policy:
1. Run a whole-repo baseline pass for high-signal built-in rulesets.
2. Separate Pro-heavy taint passes from lightweight structural passes.
3. Batch Pro-heavy passes by high-risk subsystem or architecture slice from Phase 3.
4. Use file, path, and language scoping aggressively for targeted passes.
5. Record any batching, throttling, or narrowed scope in the `## Static Analysis Summary` section of
`xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`.

The goal is bounded resource usage without losing baseline built-in coverage.

### Cleanup Commands

Run after the report is written:

```bash
# Remove CodeQL databases (can be very large)
rm -rf xevon-results/codeql-db/ xevon-results/codeql-db-*/

# Remove Semgrep cache
rm -rf ~/.semgrep/cache/

# Remove CodeQL package cache (optional — speeds up future runs if kept)
# rm -rf ~/.codeql/packages/

# Verify cleanup
du -sh xevon-results/
```

### SARIF Merging

When multiple SARIF files exist (multi-language CodeQL + Semgrep), use the `sarif-parsing` skill to merge and deduplicate:

```bash
# Quick merge with jq
jq -s '{ version: "2.1.0", runs: [ .[].runs[] ] }' \
  xevon-results/codeql-res/*.sarif \
  xevon-results/semgrep-res/*.sarif \
  > xevon-results/merged-results.sarif
```

**Output**: `## Static Analysis Summary` and `## GitHub Actions Audit` sections of
`xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`. The Static Analysis Summary must record:
- built-in CodeQL suites and rulesets run
- built-in Semgrep rulesets run
- custom CodeQL artifacts run
- custom Semgrep artifacts run
- which DFD/CFD slices drove targeted custom analysis
- any batching, throttling, or coverage tradeoffs with justification

---

## Phase 4.3 — Inline SAST Enrichment

Runs as part of Phase 4 (SAST) — not a separate phase.

**Goal**: Make the SAST findings more accurate by cross-referencing them against the threat model before chambers see them.

### SAST → Threat Model Enrichment

After reading the `## Static Analysis Summary` section of `knowledge-base-report.md`, update the KB if SAST found:
- New entry points not identified in Phase 3
- New vulnerability classes relevant to the project type
- New high-risk functionality not in the attack surface
- New boundary crossings or decision points missing from the DFD/CFD slices

### Threat Model → SAST FP Filtering

Re-evaluate each SAST finding against the threat model:

| Project Type | Common FP Patterns |
|-------------|-------------------|
| CLI tool | Command execution with user-supplied args is often intentional |
| Library | Dangerous APIs are often intentional — the caller is responsible |
| Internal service | Network-only attacks may not apply if not internet-facing |
| Admin-only feature | Requires admin access — often out of scope for bug bounty |

Mark findings as FALSE POSITIVE or OUT OF SCOPE with explicit reasoning tied to the threat model.
Use the DFD/CFD slices to check whether the finding crosses a real trust boundary or reaches a security-critical decision point.

Write enrichment verdicts to the `## SAST Enrichment` section of `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`.

---

## Phase 9: Spec Gap Analysis

**Skill**: `spec-to-code-compliance`

**Goal**: Find implementation gaps between the project's spec/RFC implementations and the actual standards, focusing on gaps that are concretely exploitable.

### Pre-Work: Read Domain Attack Research

Before fetching any spec documents, read the `## Domain Attack Research` section of
`xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`. Use the Mode C attack taxonomy and manual review checklist
as the primary list of patterns to test during spec gap analysis. This avoids re-researching
attacks that Phase 3 already catalogued and ensures spec gap analysis focuses on the highest-risk
protocol-specific patterns.

### Fetching Spec Documents

Use web search, fetch tools, or MCP to retrieve official spec documents:

```
# Examples of spec URLs to fetch
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6749  # OAuth 2.0
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519  # JWT
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110  # HTTP Semantics
https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html
```

### High-Priority Gap Categories

Focus on these categories first — they have the highest historical yield:

1. **Authentication protocol gaps**: OAuth state/nonce, JWT algorithm confusion, SAML assertion validation
2. **Parsing discrepancies**: URL parsing, header parsing, multipart parsing (see deep-analysis.md §6)
3. **Canonicalization**: case normalization, Unicode normalization, path normalization
4. **Replay and freshness**: nonce validation, timestamp checking, token invalidation after use
5. **Downgrade attacks**: forced use of weaker algorithm or protocol version

### Exploitability Filter

Only include gaps where:
- An attacker can trigger the gap without requiring physical access or pre-existing full compromise
- The gap leads to a concrete security impact (auth bypass, data exfiltration, privilege escalation)
- The gap is not already mitigated by another control in the system

**Output**: `## Spec Gap Analysis` section of `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`. If no specs were identified in Phase 3, mark "None identified" and skip.

---

## Phase 10: Review Chamber Deep Bug Hunting

**Agents**: `review-adjudicator`, `attack-designer`, `flow-tracer` (also runs inline variant expansion — Phase 12 is folded here), `red-challenger`

**Goal**: Find vulnerabilities through structured multi-agent debate. Four specialized roles
collaborate on each threat cluster to produce findings with higher creativity and lower
false-positive rates than a single auditor.

**Input**: `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md` (all sections from phases 1-6),
`xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/` (structural artifacts from Phase 4)

### Chamber Formation

1. Read `## High-Risk DFD Slices` and `## High-Risk CFD Slices` from the KB
2. Group slices by shared trust boundary or component affinity into threat clusters
3. Each cluster becomes one Review Chamber (typical: 3-8 chambers)
4. Priority order: authentication/authorization first, then data ingestion, then API surface
5. Create `xevon-results/chamber-workspace/` and `xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json`

### NNN Range Assignment

Assign non-overlapping finding ID ranges to prevent collisions across parallel chambers:
```
Chamber 1: p7-001 through p7-019
Chamber 2: p7-020 through p7-039
Chamber 3: p7-040 through p7-059
...
```

### Chamber Spawn (up to 3 concurrent)

For each chamber, create the workspace and spawn 4 agents:
```bash
mkdir -p xevon-results/chamber-workspace/<chamber-id>/{evidence,variant-candidates}
```

- **Chamber Synthesizer**: orchestrates debate, issues verdicts, writes finding drafts
- **Attack Ideator**: generates 3-7 hypotheses using 8 creative attack modes
  (see `references/creative-attack-modes.md`)
- **Code Tracer**: traces each hypothesis through code using Method 2.6
  (see `references/deep-analysis.md`); on every hypothesis the Synthesizer rules
  VALID, also runs the inline same-pattern variant search (Phase 12 methodology
  below) and files Medium+ variants alongside the chamber drafts with
  `Origin-Finding:`/`Origin-Pattern:` frontmatter
- **Devil's Advocate**: challenges every finding at 5 protection layers,
  checks 8 Claude-Specific FP patterns

### Debate Protocol

Each chamber proceeds through structured rounds via an append-only transcript at
`xevon-results/chamber-workspace/<chamber-id>/debate.md`:

```
Round 1 (Ideation):   Ideator generates 3-7 hypotheses
Round 2 (Tracing):    Tracer traces each hypothesis through code
Round 3 (Challenge):  Advocate writes defense brief per hypothesis
Round 4 (Synthesis):  Synthesizer evaluates arguments, issues verdicts
Round 5-6 (Optional): Focused re-investigation (max 2 per hypothesis)
```

**Limits**: max 7 hypotheses per batch, max 3 rounds per hypothesis, max 3 concurrent chambers.

**Convergence criteria**:
- Tracer: UNREACHABLE + Advocate confirms → DROP
- Tracer: REACHABLE + Advocate cannot disprove (2 attempts) → VALID
- Tracer: REACHABLE + Advocate finds blocking protection → FALSE POSITIVE
- 3 rounds without resolution → Synthesizer judgment call
- Low severity → DROP immediately

See `references/chamber-protocol.md` for complete format and transcript template.

### Pre-Finding Quality Gate

Before the Synthesizer writes any draft, apply 5-point check:
1. Attacker control verified by Tracer (not just inferred)?
2. Framework protection searched by Advocate (all 5 layers)?
3. Trust boundary crossing confirmed (not same-origin)?
4. Exploitation requires normal attacker position (not admin)?
5. Vulnerable code ships to production (not test/example)?

### Cross-Chamber Intelligence

`xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json` stores confirmed patterns with detection signatures
(CodeQL, grep, Semgrep). Other chambers read the registry before new ideation rounds.

### Specialized Delegations

Chambers may delegate to specialized skills for scope NOT covered by Phase 3 domain attack
research: `insecure-defaults`, `sharp-edges`, `wooyun-legacy`, `zeroize-audit`.

See [Architecture and Project Attack Pattern Catalog](#architecture-and-project-attack-pattern-catalog) for specific attack patterns.

### Knowledge Base Feedback Loop

After all chambers close:
1. Collect all finding drafts (including the inline variant drafts the Code Tracer filed)
2. Append `## Phase 10 Addendum` to KB (newly discovered attack surfaces, revised trust
   boundaries, additional DFD/CFD paths). Forward-append only — preserve Phase 3 content.
3. The inline variant search (folded Phase 12) reads the updated KB including the addendum
   as part of the same chamber pass.

**Output**: `xevon-results/findings-draft/p7-<NNN>-<slug>.md` (Medium+ only),
`xevon-results/chamber-workspace/<chamber-id>/debate.md` (audit artifacts),
`xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json`,
`## Phase 10 Addendum` appended to KB

---

## Phase 11: P11-LITE FP Elimination

**Goal**: Eliminate false positives. Reduced from full adversarial review because the Devil's
Advocate already challenged every finding during the Phase 10 chamber debate.

### Stage 1: Analytical FP Check

**Skill**: `fp-check`

**Retain**: medium-to-critical findings exploitable in a bug bounty context.

**Exclude**:
- By-design behavior (document as such with reasoning)
- Informational findings (verbose errors, version disclosure without exploit chain)
- Defense-in-depth gaps with no direct exploit path
- Issues requiring full system compromise as a prerequisite
- Admin-only abuse (unless threat model explicitly includes admin-level attackers)

**Prioritize**: findings with `Pre-FP-Flag` annotations from the chamber debate.

**Incremental verdict persistence**: Write each verdict back into the corresponding
`xevon-results/findings-draft/p7-*.md` file immediately. Add:

```
Verdict: VALID | FALSE POSITIVE | BY DESIGN | OUT OF SCOPE | DROP (low severity)
Rationale: <one-sentence explanation tied to the threat model>
```

Findings with `FALSE POSITIVE`, `BY DESIGN`, `OUT OF SCOPE`, or `DROP (low severity)` do not
proceed to Stage 2.

### Stage 2: Cold Verification (CRITICAL and HIGH only)

**Medium findings skip Stage 2** — already challenged by the Devil's Advocate during the
chamber debate. This reduces Phase 11 cost by ~60%.

**Applies to**: CRITICAL and HIGH findings with `Verdict: VALID` after Stage 1.

**Agent isolation**: Spawn a fresh agent per VALID CRITICAL/HIGH finding. The task description
contains only the finding draft file path. Do not include the debate transcript, Phase 10 reasoning,
or any other context. The fresh agent reads methodology from `references/adversarial-review.md`.

**Execution**: Cold verification reviews run in parallel across findings.

**Steps performed by each cold verifier** (detailed in `adversarial-review.md`):
1. Restate and decompose into testable sub-claims
2. Independent code path trace from entry point to sink
3. Attempt real-environment reproduction (follow `real-env-validation.md`)
4. Prosecution + defense briefs
5. Severity challenge (start at MEDIUM, require evidence to upgrade)
6. Verdict: CONFIRMED or DISPROVED

**Verdict integration**: Write results back into the finding draft:
```
Adversarial-Verdict: CONFIRMED | DISPROVED
Adversarial-Rationale: <one sentence citing the decisive evidence>
Severity-Final: <challenged severity>
PoC-Status: executed | theoretical | blocked
```
If `DISPROVED`, also update `Verdict:` to `FALSE POSITIVE (adversarial)`.

**Severity reconciliation**: lower severity always wins.

**Full review output**: `xevon-results/adversarial-reviews/<slug>-review.md` using the template
from `report-templates.md`.

**Output**: updated `xevon-results/findings-draft/` files (CRITICAL/HIGH with cold verification
verdicts), `xevon-results/adversarial-reviews/<slug>-review.md` per CRITICAL/HIGH VALID finding

---

## Phase 12: Variant Analysis (folded into the Phase 10 chamber Code Tracer)

**Not a standalone phase.** Per-finding variant analysis is folded into the Phase 10
Review Chamber Code Tracer (`flow-tracer`). There is no separate variant agent
(`variant-scanner`/`variant-spotter`) and no standalone variant phase in deep or
balanced mode — the methodology below is the Code Tracer's inline procedure, executed
on every hypothesis the Synthesizer rules VALID, while chamber context is hot.

**Skill**: `variant-analysis`

**Goal**: Find similar bugs to each confirmed finding elsewhere in the codebase.

**Primary input**: `xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json` — the structured registry of confirmed
patterns from Phase 10 Review Chambers. Each pattern includes `detection_signature` fields with
ready-made CodeQL, grep, and Semgrep queries for automated variant hunting.

For each VALID finding (run by the Code Tracer inline, before the chamber closes):
1. Read the matching pattern from `xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json`
2. Run the pattern's `detection_signature` queries (CodeQL, grep, Semgrep) across the codebase
3. Check `untested_candidates` from the registry for specific locations to investigate
4. Use DFD/CFD slices — including `## Phase 10 Addendum` additions — to search for the same
   flow shape in sibling components, alternate transports, and adjacent enforcement paths

**Incremental variant persistence**: Write each confirmed Medium+ variant immediately as its
own chamber finding draft (same `p<chamber>-<NNN>-<slug>.md` namespace as the chamber's other
drafts) with `Origin-Finding:` and `Origin-Pattern:` set in frontmatter, and append it to the
matching `xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json` pattern's `confirmed_instances`. Variants then
flow through the same FP/triage tail as every other chamber draft (stricter than the old
standalone variant phase, which is intended).

**Output**: variant drafts in the chamber's finding-draft namespace (Medium or higher only),
`xevon-results/attack-pattern-registry.json` updated with confirmed variant instances

---

## Phase 15: Exploitation & Final Reporting

**Goal**: Prove the impact of confirmed vulnerabilities through realistic Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and generate a professional, executive-ready final report.

### Task A: Draft Promotion

Before generating individual reports, promote confirmed findings from the draft staging area:

1. List all files in `xevon-results/findings-draft/` with `Verdict: VALID`.
2. Assign severity IDs (`C1`, `H1`, `M1`) in priority order across all confirmed Critical/High/Medium drafts. Discard any `F-NNN` or other sequential IDs used during Phase 10-9 drafting. Low severity findings are dropped entirely — no ID, no report, no summary table entry.
3. For each confirmed draft, create `xevon-results/findings/<ID>-<slug>/` and copy the draft as the basis for the `vuln-report` output.
4. Leave non-VALID drafts in place for the audit record.

### Task B: Realistic PoCs

For each critical, high, and medium bug:
1.  **Environment Setup**: Identify the minimum setup required for a valid reproduction.
2.  **PoC Construction**: Use the shortest, most reliable path. Ensure the PoC is representative of a real-world attack (e.g., do not bypass a security boundary that would be present in production).
3.  **Refinement**: Minimize the PoC code. Style it as a clean, effective exploit script.

**Real-environment execution mandate for CRITICAL/HIGH findings**: For every CRITICAL or HIGH finding promoted to `xevon-results/findings/`, PoC execution in a real environment is required before the final report is generated. Reuse the Stage 2 adversarial environment if it was successfully provisioned; otherwise provision a new environment following `real-env-validation.md`.

Capture evidence in `xevon-results/findings/<ID>-<slug>/evidence/`:
```
xevon-results/findings/<ID>-<slug>/evidence/
  setup.sh         # provisioning commands
  exploit.sh       # PoC exploit script
  exploit.log      # full output of PoC execution
  impact.log       # impact evidence
```

Annotate each CRITICAL/HIGH finding with:
```
PoC-Status: executed | theoretical | blocked
```

If execution is blocked, document the specific reason. Do not report a CRITICAL/HIGH finding without this annotation. A `PoC-Status: theoretical` finding must include a `PoC-Block-Reason:` line explaining why execution was not possible.

### Task C: Individual Vulnerability Reports

Invoke the `vuln-report` skill for each valid finding:
-   **ID Mapping**: Use severity prefixes `C1`, `H1`, `M1` (Critical/High/Medium). Do not invoke `vuln-report` for Low severity findings.
-   **Naming Convention**: Save each report to `xevon-results/findings/<ID>-<slug>/report.md`.
-   **Structure**: Follow the required sections (Summary, Details, Root Cause, PoC, Impact) exactly as defined in `vuln-report/SKILL.md`.

### Task D: Consolidated Pentest-Style Report

This is the mandatory final step to synthesize the entire audit. Generate `xevon-results/final-audit-report.md` using the template in `audit/references/report-templates.md`.

**Required Content**:
-   **Executive Summary**: High-level risk assessment for non-technical stakeholders.
-   **Methodology Summary**: Overview of Phases 1-9 to establish technical depth.
-   **Summary Table**: A prioritized list of all **VALID** findings with IDs and severity.
-   **Technical Detail Links**: Technical summaries for each valid finding, linking to the detailed `vuln-report` and PoC.
-   **Conclusion**: Final professional assessment of the project's security posture.

### Task E: Post-Audit Cleanup

After the consolidated report is written, delete all working artifacts. Only the knowledge base, final report, and individual findings are retained.

```bash
rm -rf xevon-results/findings-draft/
rm -rf xevon-results/adversarial-reviews/
rm -rf xevon-results/real-env-evidence/
rm -rf xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/
rm -rf xevon-results/codeql-queries/
rm -rf xevon-results/semgrep-rules/
rm -f xevon-results/audit-state.json
rm -f xevon-results/merged-results.sarif
rm -f xevon-results/bounty-scope.md
```

Verify retained output:
```bash
ls xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md xevon-results/final-audit-report.md xevon-results/findings/
```

These are generic patterns that apply based on project type. For technology-domain-specific attack
patterns (SAML, OAuth, JWT, HTTP smuggling, gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket, XML/SOAP, TLS, DNS, SMTP,
LDAP, SSH, serialization, compression, crypto), see `references/domain-attack-playbooks.md`.
Domain patterns from Phase 3 Mode C are always higher-priority targets than the generic patterns
below because they are tailored to the project's specific implementation.

### Cross-Cutting Architecture Patterns

Apply these regardless of product type:

| Pattern | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Trust-boundary handoff | gateways, workers, handlers, adapters, clients | Does security context change or get widened when crossing the boundary? |
| Wrapper blindness | custom middleware, helper layers, generated SDKs | Do built-in SAST rules miss the real source, summary, or sink? |
| Control-plane vs data-plane confusion | admin APIs, job runners, orchestrators, schedulers | Can low-trust input trigger higher-privilege control actions? |
| Identity propagation drift | session, token, metadata, headers, claims | Is caller identity preserved, narrowed, and re-verified on each hop? |
| Async guarantee mismatch | queues, events, retries, delayed jobs | Does the consumer assume validation or auth happened earlier when it did not? |
| Schema or parser differential | serializers, IDLs, schemas, validators | Do two layers parse or normalize the same input differently? |

### Web Application

**Primary concerns**: SSRF, XSS, SQLi, auth bypass, IDOR, mass assignment

| Attack | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| SSRF | URL fetching, webhooks, import features, PDF generation | Can the server be made to fetch internal URLs? |
| Stored XSS | User-generated content, profile fields, comments | Is output HTML-encoded in all rendering contexts? |
| SQLi | Search, filter, sort parameters | Is user input concatenated into queries? |
| IDOR | Resource access by ID | Is ownership verified, not just existence? |
| Mass assignment | JSON/form body to model | Are protected fields excluded from bulk assignment? |
| Open redirect | `next`, `return_to`, `redirect` parameters | Is the destination validated against an allowlist? |
| CSRF | State-changing POST/PUT/DELETE | Is the CSRF token bound to the session? |
| Path traversal | File download, template rendering | Is the path normalized before the access check? |

### Library

**Primary concerns**: unsafe deserialization, injection via API misuse, prototype pollution, ReDoS

| Attack | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Unsafe deserialization | `deserialize()`, `parse()`, `fromJSON()` | Are type constraints enforced? |
| Prototype pollution (JS) | Object merge, deep clone, `set()` with dot-path | Can `__proto__` be set via user input? |
| ReDoS | Regex patterns applied to user input | Does the pattern have catastrophic backtracking? |
| Path traversal via API | File path parameters | Is the path sanitized before use? |
| Command injection | Shell command construction from caller input | Is caller input shell-escaped? |

### CLI Tool

**Primary concerns**: argument injection, path traversal, symlink attacks, env var injection

| Attack | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Argument injection | Values passed to `exec()`, `spawn()` | Are user-supplied values shell-escaped? |
| Path traversal | File arguments, config file paths | Are paths normalized and confined to expected dirs? |
| Symlink attack | Temp file creation, file operations | Does the tool follow symlinks it should not? |
| Env var injection | Reading sensitive config from environment | Can a lower-privileged process influence the env? |

### Plugin / Extension

**Primary concerns**: sandbox escape, privilege escalation, supply chain, cross-plugin leakage

| Attack | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Sandbox escape | Host API access, native module loading | Can the plugin access APIs beyond its permissions? |
| Privilege escalation | Host operations triggered by plugin | Does the host re-verify permissions before acting? |
| Supply chain | Remote code fetching, auto-update | Is fetched code integrity-verified? |
| Cross-plugin leakage | Shared storage, event bus | Can one plugin read another's data? |

### Protocol Implementation

**Primary concerns**: spec non-compliance, token forgery, replay, downgrade

| Attack | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Token forgery | Signature verification, algorithm selection | Is the algorithm verified before the signature? |
| Replay attack | Nonce/timestamp validation | Are nonces stored and checked for reuse? |
| Downgrade | Algorithm negotiation | Can the attacker force a weaker algorithm? |
| State machine bypass | Multi-step flows | Can steps be skipped or reordered? |

### Infrastructure / Agent

**Primary concerns**: SSRF, secret exfiltration, command injection, lateral movement

| Attack | Where to Look | Key Question |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| SSRF | Job parameters, webhook URLs, artifact fetching | Can job input reach internal metadata endpoints? |
| Secret exfiltration | Log output, error messages, debug endpoints | Are secrets masked in all output paths? |
| Command injection | Job parameters passed to shell | Are parameters shell-escaped? |
| Lateral movement | Credentials scope, IAM roles | Are credentials scoped to minimum required permissions? |
