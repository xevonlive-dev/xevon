# Domain-Specific Attack Playbooks

Reference for Mode C of Phase 3 Domain Attack Research. Provides per-domain attack patterns,
research signals, and mapping to testing skills.

---

## Domain Identification Signals

Trigger Mode C when any of the following are detected during Phase 3 Steps 1-2:

| Signal | Where to look | Example trigger |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|
| Protocol/format keyword in project name or description | README, package.json, go.mod, Cargo.toml | "saml", "oauth", "jwt", "grpc", "graphql", "mqtt" |
| RFC/spec listed in `## Specs and RFCs Implemented` | Phase 3 Step 2 output | RFC 6749, RFC 7519, RFC 9110 |
| Security-sensitive library in dependencies | manifests, lockfiles | xmlsec, python-jose, openssl, bouncycastle, pyyaml, pickle |
| Transport, storage, or compute type in architecture inventory | Phase 3 Step 2 | WebSocket, gRPC, Kafka, Redis, S3, Lambda, Docker |
| Project type is `protocol`, `library`, `plugin`, `CI action` | Step 1 classification | OIDC provider, SAML SP, image processor, template renderer |
| Auth/crypto/parsing/rendering in component names | DFD slices | `SAMLValidator`, `OAuthHandler`, `TemplateEngine`, `PDFRenderer` |
| Keyword in source files | grep across codebase | `subprocess`, `eval`, `pickle.loads`, `Template(`, `innerHTML` |
| Cloud provider SDK import | imports, dependencies | boto3, google-cloud, azure-sdk, @aws-sdk |
| AI/ML framework import | imports, dependencies | openai, anthropic, transformers, langchain, torch |

Produce a list of identified domains at the top of the `## Domain Attack Research` section.

---

## Research Action Sequence

For each identified domain, perform in order:

1. **Web search** — search for `"<domain> known attacks"`, `"<domain> security vulnerabilities"`,
   `"<domain> CVE analysis"`, `"<domain> implementation pitfalls"`. Use `WebSearch` and `WebFetch`.

2. **`last30days` skill** — invoke with query `"<domain> security vulnerability attack bypass"` to
   surface recent CVE discussions, bypass technique posts, and new attack research.

3. **`wooyun-legacy` skill** (conditional) — invoke only when the domain intersects with web
   application security (HTTP, auth, session, XML, file handling). See per-domain mapping below.

4. **MCP tools** (best-effort) — use `mcp__docker-gateway__perplexity_research`,
   `mcp__docker-gateway__tavily_research`, or `mcp__docker-gateway__brave_web_search` for deeper
   technical research when available. Fall back to `WebSearch` if MCP tools are unavailable.

5. **Build attack taxonomy** — classify each discovered attack by: attack class, prerequisites,
   detection strategy, SAST detectability (yes/no/partial), and relevance to this project's
   implementation.

## Notes for threat-modeler

- Run Mode C in parallel with Mode A and Mode B when they overlap. Do not skip Mode A/B because
  Mode C is being run.
- **Token budget**: bound each domain research to one `last30days` call, one `wooyun-legacy` read,
  and 3-5 web searches. Do not research more than 5 domains in depth in a single session without
  explicit user instruction. Prioritize by relevance to high-risk DFD/CFD slices.
- When MCP tools are unavailable, `WebSearch` + `WebFetch` of top 2-3 results is sufficient.
- The attack taxonomy produced here is the primary input for Phase 4 custom SAST rule generation
  and Phase 9 spec gap analysis. Quality over quantity — a focused 5-item checklist is more useful
  than an exhaustive 30-item generic list.
- Record which research sources were used in the `## Domain Attack Research` section for auditability.
- **Domain identification is exhaustive, not exclusive**: a single project may trigger 5+ domains.
