## audit-state.json Schema

`xevon-results/audit-state.json` is an append-only audit history. Each audit run is appended as a new
entry in the `audits` array. Earlier entries are never overwritten — they form the permanent record
of every audit cycle against this repository. The current (in-progress or most recently completed)
audit is always the last entry.

```json
{
  "audits": [
    {
      "audit_id": "<YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ>",
      "commit": "<git SHA>",
      "branch": "<branch name>",
      "repository": "<org/repo or folder name>",
      "started_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
      "completed_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp or null if in progress>",
      "status": "complete | in_progress | failed",
      "phases": {
        "1": {
          "status": "complete | in_progress | failed | skipped",
          "started_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
          "completed_at": "<ISO 8601 timestamp>",
          "metrics": {
            "findings_count": 0,
            "reports_generated": ["knowledge-base-report.md"],
            "validation_passed": true,
            "error": null
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Field notes:
- `audit_id`: ISO 8601 timestamp of when the audit started; unique identifier for the run
- `commit`: HEAD commit SHA at audit start; used for incremental re-audit diffing
- `repository`: org/repo slug from git remote origin (e.g. `org/reponame`), or working directory basename if no remote is configured
- `status` (audit-level): overall status of the audit run
- `findings_count`: number of candidate findings at phase completion (0 for phases that do not generate findings)
- `reports_generated`: list of KB sections or artifact files written during this phase
- `validation_passed`: result of running `validate_phase_output.py` for this phase
- `error`: validation error message if `validation_passed` is false; null otherwise

**Appending a new audit**: before starting a new audit run, read the existing file, append a new
entry to the `audits` array with `status: "in_progress"`, and write the file back. Never replace
the array or remove existing entries. If the file does not exist, create it with a single-entry
array.

**Re-audit detection**: to determine whether this is a re-audit, compare the current HEAD SHA
against `audits[-1].commit` (the most recent completed entry). If they differ, this is a re-audit;
load the KB sections from `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md` as the starting knowledge base.

For Phase 4, `reports_generated` must include `xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/entry-points.json`,
`xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/sinks.json`, `xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/call-graph-slices.json`, and
`xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/flow-paths-all-severities.md`, plus the `## Static Analysis Summary`
section written to `xevon-results/attack-surface/knowledge-base-report.md`. Missing any causes `validation_passed: false`.

Phase 4 `metrics` must include a `codeql_structural` sub-object:

```json
"codeql_structural": {
  "entry_points_count": 0,
  "sinks_count": 0,
  "slices_reachable": 0,
  "slices_not_reachable": 0,
  "informational_results_count": 0,
  "db_path": "xevon-results/codeql-artifacts/db/"
}
```

## Finding Draft Template

Used for `xevon-results/findings-draft/<phase>-<NNN>-<slug>.md` files written incrementally during Phases 7-9.

```markdown
# [Finding Title]

Phase: 7 | 8 | 9
Sequence: NNN
Slug: <slug>
Verdict: PENDING | VALID | FALSE POSITIVE | BY DESIGN | OUT OF SCOPE | FALSE POSITIVE (adversarial)
Rationale: <one-sentence explanation tied to the threat model — fill in during Phase 11>
Adversarial-Verdict: PENDING | CONFIRMED | DISPROVED
Adversarial-Rationale: <one sentence citing the decisive evidence — fill in during Phase 11 Stage 2>
Severity-Original: <severity assigned during Phase 10/8 Stage 1>
Severity-Final: <severity after adversarial challenge — lower severity wins>
PoC-Status: executed | theoretical | blocked
Pre-FP-Flag: <none | check-N-ambiguous — set by chamber Synthesizer if quality gate was ambiguous>
Debate: <path to chamber debate transcript, e.g., xevon-results/chamber-workspace/chamber-01/debate.md>

## Summary

[One-sentence description of the vulnerability.]

## Location

File: <path>
Function/Method: <name>
Line: <number>

## Attacker Control

[What input does the attacker control, and how does it reach the vulnerable code?]

## Trust Boundary Crossed

[Which trust boundary is violated?]

## Impact

[Concrete attacker gain: what can the attacker do?]

## Evidence

[Code snippet or logic trace showing the vulnerable path.]

## Reproduction Steps

[Minimal steps to trigger the issue.]
```

## PoC Quality Requirements

Apply these requirements to every PoC produced in Phase 15 and Phase 11 Stage 2:

- **Prove the vulnerability, do not manufacture it.** The PoC must demonstrate the actual exploit path through the real application stack — not a stripped-down harness that bypasses the security controls under test. Bug bounty triagers reject PoCs that call the vulnerable function directly while skipping the auth layer, middleware, or sandbox that would normally gate access.
- **Minimize the PoC to its essential steps.** Remove all scaffolding, retry loops, verbose logging, and diagnostic output that are not necessary to trigger the vulnerability. The finished script should read like a CTF exploit: tight, purposeful, and self-contained.
- **Demonstrate the security effect.** The PoC must show the concrete attacker gain — data exfiltration, code execution, authentication bypass, privilege escalation — not merely that an error occurs.
- **Capture evidence.** For Critical and High findings, save execution output to `xevon-results/findings/<ID>-<slug>/evidence/` (screenshots, response captures, or log snippets).
- **Label PoC-Status accurately.** Use `executed` only if the PoC ran successfully against a real environment. Use `theoretical` if only code-level analysis was performed. Use `blocked` with a `PoC-Block-Reason:` if environment provisioning failed.

## Adversarial Review Template

# Security Audit Report: [Project Name]
=========================================

## Executive Summary
---------------------
[Concise high-level summary of the overall security posture. Identify the most critical risks and the general impact on the business or project stakeholders. Aim for a one-paragraph summary for non-technical audiences.]

## Methodology Summary
-----------------------
[Briefly describe the audit process (Phases 1-9) to establish technical depth.]
- **Intelligence Gathering:** Identified published advisories, architecture, and dependency risks.
- **Threat Modeling:** Documented trust boundaries, attacker entry points, and high-risk flows.
- **Static Analysis:** Executed CodeQL, Semgrep Pro, and custom architecture-driven rules.
- **Structural Extraction:** CodeQL structural artifacts (entry points, sinks, call graph slices,
  informational flow nodes, machine-generated DFD/CFD diagrams) were extracted and used to validate
  Phase 3 DFD/CFD slices, guide manual review in Phase 10, and drive AST-level variant hunting in
  Phase 12.
- **Deep Manual Review:** Targeted bug hunting focusing on logic, bypasses, and spec compliance.
- **Verification:** All findings were validated for exploitability within the project's threat model.
