## Context

- Audit context (orchestrator-supplied directives + user prose, if any): !`cat xevon-results/audit-context.md 2>/dev/null || echo "(none)"`
- Audit state: !`cat xevon-results/audit-state.json 2>/dev/null || echo "No audit state found"`
- Git availability: !`git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "Git worktree detected" || echo "No git worktree (diff mode unavailable)"`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "No git branch (plain directory target)"`
- Latest commit: !`git log --oneline -1 2>/dev/null || echo "No git history available"`

## Your Task

Run an incremental audit covering only changes since the last audited commit.

### Process

1. Verify Git history is available with `git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree >/dev/null 2>&1`.
2. If Git is unavailable, stop and tell the user incremental diff mode is unsupported for plain source folders. Direct them to `/xevon-audit:lite`, `/xevon-audit:balanced`, or `/xevon-audit:deep` instead.
3. Read `audits[-1].commit` from `xevon-results/audit-state.json`. If no state file exists, direct the user to `/xevon-audit:deep`.
4. If `audits[-1].history_available` is `false`, stop and tell the user the previous audit ran without local history, so there is no reliable diff base. Direct them to run a fresh audit.
5. If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a commit range, use that instead.
6. Compute the diff: `git diff <audits[-1].commit>..HEAD --stat`
7. Map changed files to affected phases:

| Change Type | Phases to Re-Run |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Core source code | D5 (Code Scan), D6 (Deep Probe) |
| Auth/security modules | D4 (Threat Model), D5, D6 |
| Dependencies (lockfiles, manifests) | D1/D2 (Intelligence Pass), D4, D5 |
| Workflow files (.github/) | D5 (Code Scan — Actions audit) |
| Config files | D5 (Code Scan — inline enrichment) |
| Documentation only | None |
| Test files only | None |

8. Re-run only the affected phases in order, following the full methodology for each.
9. Set `audits[-1].completed_at` to current timestamp and `audits[-1].status` to `complete` after all affected phases finish. Append a new audit entry via the same schema if this diff audit constitutes a full re-audit.
10. Update phase timestamps in `audits[-1].phases`.
