// These tests guard the per-phase max_duration enforcement. The original bug:
// the known-issue-scan phase computed the right budget but only applied it to
// one leg (Nuclei) while the Kingfisher leg ran unbounded, so the phase could
// overrun max_duration. The fix routes every phase deadline through phaseDeadline.
//
// known-issue-scan later moved its two legs from ONE shared budget to INDEPENDENT
// per-leg budgets, so a Nuclei run that consumes its whole budget no longer starves
// the Kingfisher secret scan (TestPhaseDeadline_IndependentLegsEachGetOwnBudget).
// The shared-budget property still holds for phases that bound all their work under
// a single deadline (TestPhaseDeadline_BoundsSequentialLegs).
//
// Durations are kept small but upper-bound tolerances are generous so the tests
// stay deterministic on slow/loaded CI without false failures.

// roughly maxDuration out, and the context expires with DeadlineExceeded.
