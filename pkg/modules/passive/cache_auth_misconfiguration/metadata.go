	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects responses that are publicly cacheable (Cache-Control: public or s-maxage) but
contain user-specific indicators (Set-Cookie, Authorization) without proper Vary headers.
This can lead to one user's authenticated response being served from cache to another
user, causing data leakage or session confusion.

## Notes
- Passive only — does not send any HTTP requests
- Skips static assets (JS, CSS, images, fonts)
- Checks for Cache-Control: public or s-maxage without no-store/private
- Reports missing Vary: Cookie when Set-Cookie is present
- Reports missing Vary: Authorization when Authorization header was in request
- Deduplicates by host+path
