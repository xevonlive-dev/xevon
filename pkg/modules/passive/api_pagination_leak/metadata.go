Passively detects API pagination metadata in JSON responses that reveals total record
counts, page counts, or cursor-based navigation details. This information can disclose
how many records exist in a collection, which may reveal business-sensitive data such as
user counts, order volumes, or internal resource quantities.

## Notes
- Checks JSON response bodies for common pagination fields (total_count, total, totalItems, etc.)
- Only triggers on JSON responses to avoid false positives
- Deduplicates by host+path to avoid redundant findings
- Reports matched fields and their values as extracted results
