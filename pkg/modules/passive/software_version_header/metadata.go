Passively detects HTTP response headers that reveal exact software version numbers.
Headers such as Server, X-Powered-By, X-AspNet-Version, and X-AspNetMvc-Version
frequently expose the underlying technology stack and its version, enabling attackers
to search for known CVEs targeting those specific versions.

## Notes
- Checks common version-disclosing headers against version number patterns
- Only reports when an actual version number is present (not just a product name)
- Deduplicates by host to report each server's version headers once
- Extracts the header name, product, and version for each finding
