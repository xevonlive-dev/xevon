	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects verbose stack traces in HTTP responses that expose internal file paths,
line numbers, and function names. Unlike the generic error-message-detect module,
this module specifically targets multi-line stack trace patterns with file system
paths, providing higher confidence findings for each technology stack.

Covers Go, Java, Python, Ruby, Node.js, .NET/C#, and PHP stack traces.

## Notes
- Uses multiline-aware regex patterns to detect structured stack traces
- Each technology stack has its own detection pattern and severity
- Requires at least one file path with line number to confirm a stack trace
- Deduplicates by host+path to avoid redundant findings
