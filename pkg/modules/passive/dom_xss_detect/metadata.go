Passively detects potential DOM-based XSS patterns by analyzing JavaScript code in
responses for dangerous source-to-sink data flows.

## Notes
- Scans response bodies for known DOM XSS source patterns (location.hash, document.referrer, etc.)
- Identifies dangerous sink patterns (innerHTML, eval, document.write, etc.)
- Pattern-based detection; manual verification recommended
