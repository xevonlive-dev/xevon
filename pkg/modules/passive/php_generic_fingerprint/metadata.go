	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Passively identifies PHP installations not already covered by a framework
fingerprint (WordPress, Laravel, Drupal, Joomla, Symfony). Catches standalone
PHP applications, custom PHP backends, and legacy sites via the X-Powered-By
header, PHPSESSID session cookie, and .php URL extensions.

## Signals
- X-Powered-By header containing PHP/<version>
- Set-Cookie: PHPSESSID=
- URL path ending in .php (weak — requires another signal)

## Notes
- Passive only: does not send any HTTP requests
- Deduplicates by host
- Publishes "php" to the tech registry so php-tagged active modules run

## References
- https://www.php.net/`
