Passively identifies Laravel installations by analyzing HTTP response headers,
cookies (laravel_session, XSRF-TOKEN), body patterns (csrf-token meta tag,
Illuminate error strings), and Sanctum/Passport indicators. Requires 2+
independent signals to avoid false positives.

## Notes
- Passive only: does not send any HTTP requests
- Deduplicates by host to avoid redundant processing
- Extracts version hints from error pages and headers when available
- Reports as informational severity
