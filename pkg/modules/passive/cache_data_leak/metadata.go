Scans JavaScript and TypeScript response bodies for Next.js caching and static
generation patterns that may inadvertently leak authenticated or user-specific data.
Static pages (getStaticProps, force-static) are generated at build time and served
to all users, so including session-dependent data causes cross-user data leakage.
Similarly, unstable_cache without user-scoped keys or server fetches without
cache: "no-store" may serve stale authenticated responses to different users.

## Notes
- Passive only - does not send any HTTP requests
- Detects: getStaticProps with auth, force-static with auth, unstable_cache without user key
- Also detects server component fetches with auth headers but without no-store/revalidate:0
- CWE-524: Use of Cache That Contains Sensitive Information
- Deduplicates by host+path
