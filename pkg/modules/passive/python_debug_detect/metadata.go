Passively detects Python tracebacks, debug information, and path disclosure in
HTTP responses. Identifies full Python tracebacks, file path disclosure via
site-packages paths, Django debug pages, and Werkzeug Debugger exposure. Each
detection pattern generates a separate finding with appropriate severity.

## Notes
- Passive only: does not send any HTTP requests
- Deduplicates by host + detection type to avoid spam
- Werkzeug Debugger: Critical severity (potential RCE)
- Full Python traceback: High severity (secrets/paths exposed)
- Django debug page: High severity
- File path disclosure: Medium severity
