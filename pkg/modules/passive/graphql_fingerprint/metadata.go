Passively identifies GraphQL endpoints by matching common GraphQL paths
(/graphql, /v1/graphql, /api/graphql) and inspecting JSON responses for
GraphQL-specific shapes ("data", "errors" arrays with locations).

## Signals
- URL path matches a known GraphQL endpoint pattern
- Response body contains a top-level {"data": …} or {"errors": [{"message": …, "locations": [...]}]} shape

## Notes
- Passive only: does not send any HTTP requests
- Publishes "graphql" to the tech registry so graphql-tagged active modules run`
