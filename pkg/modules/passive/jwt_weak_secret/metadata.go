Passively detects JWT tokens signed with weak HMAC secrets by performing offline
brute-force against an embedded wordlist of ~104K known weak secrets.

When an asymmetric-algorithm JWT (RS256, ES256, etc.) is found but no HMAC secret
matches, emits a low-severity informational finding noting the potential for
algorithm confusion (CVE-2015-9235). Active testing is recommended to confirm.

## Notes
- Extracts JWTs from Authorization Bearer headers and cookies
- Tests HMAC-based algorithms (HS256, HS384, HS512)
- Detects non-cryptographic (plaintext ASCII) signatures indicating trivially forgeable tokens
- Tests algorithm confusion (CVE-2015-9235): tries HS256/HS384/HS512 brute-force on asymmetric tokens (RS256, ES256, etc.)
- Emits informational finding for asymmetric JWTs even when no weak secret is found
- Computes HMAC signatures offline without sending additional requests
- Uses embedded jwt.secrets.list wordlist
