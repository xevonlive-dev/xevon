Ranks HTTP responses by statistical anomaly to identify interesting endpoints. Buffers
responses per host and applies statistical ranking when thresholds are reached.

## Notes
- Buffers per-host response attributes and flushes at configurable thresholds
- Uses statistical analysis to identify outlier responses worth investigating
- Updates risk_score on database records for prioritization
