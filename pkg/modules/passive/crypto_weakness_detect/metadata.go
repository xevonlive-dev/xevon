Detects cryptographic weaknesses in HTTP responses and cookies, including PHP magic hashes,
weak hash algorithms near sensitive contexts, padding oracle indicators, and encrypted cookies
without integrity protection (MAC).

## Notes
- Analyzes both request cookies and response headers/body
- Checks for MD5/SHA1 usage near password, token, or hash keywords
- Detects padding oracle error messages that may enable ciphertext manipulation
- Identifies encrypted cookie values that lack HMAC integrity verification
