Passively identifies WordPress installations from HTML responses, extracts core
version information, and builds an inventory of installed plugins and themes by
parsing asset URLs (/wp-content/plugins/<slug>/, /wp-content/themes/<slug>/).

## Notes
- Passive only: does not send any HTTP requests
- Detects WordPress via /wp-content/, /wp-includes/, wp-json, X-Pingback header, generator meta tag
- Extracts version from generator meta tag and RSS feed generator element
- Enumerates plugin/theme slugs from asset URL paths
- Deduplicates by host to avoid redundant processing
