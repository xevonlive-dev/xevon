Passively detects verbose GraphQL error responses that leak internal implementation details
such as resolver names, field suggestions, type information, database errors, and stack traces.
These errors can help attackers enumerate the schema, discover hidden fields, and identify
backend technologies without requiring introspection access.

## Notes
- Checks JSON response bodies for GraphQL error array structure
- Detects field suggestion leaks ("Did you mean ...?")
- Detects resolver/type name exposure in error paths
- Detects database and ORM errors surfaced through GraphQL
- Deduplicates by host+path to avoid redundant findings
