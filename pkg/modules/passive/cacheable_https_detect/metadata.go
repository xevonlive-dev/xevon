Passively detects HTTPS responses containing sensitive content (Set-Cookie headers or
password fields) that lack proper cache-control directives, allowing browsers or proxies
to cache sensitive data.

## Notes
- Only fires on HTTPS URLs with sensitive response indicators
- Checks for Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, or private
- Also checks Pragma: no-cache as legacy fallback
- Missing or permissive cache control on sensitive responses is flagged
