Passively scans HTTP response bodies for leaked secrets, credentials, API keys,
and connection strings using the Kingfisher secret detection engine.

## Notes
- Scans response bodies only (no additional HTTP requests sent)
- Skips binary/media content types
- Uses lazy-initialized singleton Kingfisher scanner
- Generates one finding per detected secret
