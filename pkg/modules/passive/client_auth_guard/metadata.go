Scans JavaScript and TypeScript response bodies for Next.js client components that
implement authentication guards purely on the client side using useEffect redirects.
Client-side auth checks can be trivially bypassed by disabling JavaScript or
manipulating the DOM, leaving protected routes accessible without authentication.

## Notes
- Passive only - does not send any HTTP requests
- Detects "use client" directive combined with useEffect-based auth redirects
- Flags when no server-side auth indicators are found alongside client redirects
- Covers router.push/replace to login/signin/auth and window.location redirects
- Deduplicates by host+path
- CWE-862: Missing Authorization
