Detects HTTP response header injection vulnerabilities where user-supplied parameter values
are copied into response headers (e.g. Set-Cookie, Location). By injecting CRLF sequences,
an attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers or break into the response body.

## Impact
- HTTP response splitting: inject arbitrary headers or body content
- Cache poisoning: poison proxy caches with attacker-controlled responses
- Cross-site scripting: inject JavaScript via crafted response body
- Session fixation: inject Set-Cookie headers
