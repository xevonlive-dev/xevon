	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Injects OAST (Out-of-Band Application Security Testing) callback URLs into HTTP headers
and URL-like parameters to detect blind vulnerabilities such as blind SSRF, blind XXE,
and blind command injection.

## Notes
- Requires an interactsh server (configured via oast settings)
- Injects unique callback URLs into headers: Referer, X-Forwarded-For, X-Forwarded-Host, Origin, X-Original-URL
- For insertion point scanning, targets parameters with URL-like values
- Findings arrive asynchronously via the polling callback — this module returns nil results directly
- DNS-only callbacks are reported as Info; HTTP callbacks are reported as High severity
- OWASP Top 10 2021: A10 (SSRF)
