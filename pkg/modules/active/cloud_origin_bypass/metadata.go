	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects when cloud storage origins are directly reachable with weaker security controls
than the CDN/WAF layer. Identifies CDN presence from headers, extracts origin storage
URLs from response body, and compares security headers between CDN and origin.

## Notes
- Step 1: Detect CDN from CF-Ray, X-Cache, Via, X-Amz-Cf-Id, X-Served-By headers
- Step 2: Extract origin storage URLs from response body
- Step 3: Fetch origin directly and compare security headers
- Flags when origin is reachable with weaker controls (missing CSP, XFO, XCTO, HSTS)
- Runs once per host with deduplication
