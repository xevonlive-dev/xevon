Detects LDAP injection vulnerabilities by injecting malformed LDAP filter expressions into
parameters that are likely used in LDAP queries (e.g., username, search, filter). Uses both
error-based detection (checking for LDAP error messages in responses) and boolean-based
detection (comparing responses with wildcard vs. baseline).

## Notes
- Only tests parameters whose name suggests LDAP usage (username, uid, cn, filter, etc.)
- Checks for LDAP error messages that were not present in the baseline response
- Boolean-based detection uses a 3-way differential: the wildcard probe must
  diverge from BOTH the baseline AND a no-match control probe by a substantial
  body delta (absolute and relative), filtering out endpoints that simply
  reflect any user input
- Deduplication via RHM to avoid redundant requests
