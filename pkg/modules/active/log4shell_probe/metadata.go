Detects Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) and related Log4j JNDI injection vulnerabilities by
injecting JNDI lookup payloads into HTTP headers and request parameters. Uses OAST
(Out-of-band Application Security Testing) callbacks to confirm exploitation.

## Notes
- Requires an interactsh server (configured via oast settings)
- Injects JNDI payloads into common HTTP headers (X-Forwarded-For, User-Agent, etc.)
- Tests multiple JNDI obfuscation patterns to bypass WAF rules
- Injects JNDI payloads into request parameters via insertion points
- Findings arrive asynchronously via the OAST polling callback
- Deduplication via DiskSet (per-request) and RHM (per-insertion-point)
