	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Sends a wordlist of plausible undocumented JSON-RPC method names against an
MCP server (` + "`debug/*`" + `, ` + "`admin/*`" + `, ` + "`_internal/*`" + `, ` + "`system/*`" + `,
` + "`sampling/*`" + `, ` + "`logging/*`" + `, ` + "`roots/*`" + `, etc.) and reports any that
return a JSON-RPC ` + "`result`" + ` instead of a "method not found" error.

## Why this matters
The MCP spec deliberately keeps the method namespace open-ended. Real-world
servers ship developer/maintenance methods that bypass the documented auth
gates around ` + "`tools/call`" + ` etc. Enumerating these is high-leverage recon.

## Detection
A method is treated as exposed when the response is a JSON-RPC envelope with
either a non-empty ` + "`result`" + ` or a server-side error code that is not the
standard -32601 ("method not found").
