Probes for framework-specific documentation, metrics, and debug endpoints exposed
by Fastify and Hono Node.js frameworks. These frameworks may inadvertently expose
Swagger documentation, API references, metrics endpoints, and overview pages in
production deployments.

## Notes
- Runs once per host with internal deduplication
- Tests 8 framework-specific paths across Fastify and Hono
- Each probe has tailored response matching to reduce false positives
