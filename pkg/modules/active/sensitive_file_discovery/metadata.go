Discovers sensitive files and endpoints exposed on the web server using two
validation strategies. High-confidence probes (~25 paths) use content markers
to confirm findings. Bulk probes (~1,350 paths covering dot files, extensionless
files, and log files) use Content-Type and body differencing against a 404
fingerprint.

## Notes
- Runs once per unique host
- Marker-based probes: ~25 paths with content marker validation (firm confidence)
- Generic probes: ~1,350 paths with Content-Type and body differencing (tentative confidence)
- Generic probes are skipped if the 404 page returns text/plain or octet-stream
- Fingerprints 404 responses to avoid false positives from custom error pages
