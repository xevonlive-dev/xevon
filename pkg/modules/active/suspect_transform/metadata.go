Detects suspicious input transformations that may indicate vulnerabilities, including
expression evaluation, quote consumption, and unicode normalization issues.

## Notes
- Tests for server-side expression evaluation (math, string operations)
- Detects quote consumption that may indicate injection contexts
- Identifies unicode normalization that could bypass security filters
