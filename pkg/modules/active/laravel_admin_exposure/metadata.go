	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Probes for unauthenticated access to Laravel admin panels (Nova, Filament,
Backpack, Voyager), API documentation endpoints (Swagger UI, L5-Swagger,
Scramble, OpenAPI specs), and GraphQL endpoints with introspection enabled.
These surfaces increase attack surface and may expose sensitive data or
admin functionality.

## Notes
- Runs once per host to avoid redundant probing
- Validates responses with content markers to reduce false positives
- Fingerprints 404 responses to detect custom error pages
- Admin panels reported as high severity; API docs as informational/low
