Tests cloud storage endpoints for bucket/container not-found conditions that indicate
potential subdomain takeover. Checks for S3 NoSuchBucket, GCS bucket-not-found,
and Azure ContainerNotFound errors.

## Notes
- Only runs on hosts identified as cloud storage endpoints
- GET / and check for specific not-found error patterns
- Takeover risk exists when DNS points to storage but bucket is unclaimed
- Runs once per host with deduplication
