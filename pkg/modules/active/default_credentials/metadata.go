	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects login endpoints from observed traffic and tests them with common default credential
pairs. Uses intelligent login form detection, CAPTCHA awareness, and lockout protection.

## Notes
- Only tests POST requests with form-encoded or JSON bodies
- Detects login endpoints by matching parameter names and URL paths
- Sends baseline invalid credentials first to establish failure response
- Stops on first successful login or lockout detection
- 500ms delay between credential attempts to avoid rate limiting
- Preserves CSRF tokens and hidden form fields during testing
