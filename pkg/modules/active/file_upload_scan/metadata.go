	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Tests file upload endpoints for unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities by attempting
to upload files with various bypass techniques. If upload succeeds, attempts to verify
execution of the uploaded file.

## Notes
- Only triggers on multipart/form-data requests with a filename parameter
- Tests 7 probe types: direct extension, double extension, null byte, case variation, magic bytes, SVG XXE, and HTML XSS
- Each probe uses a unique marker for verification
- Reconstructs multipart body preserving non-file fields (CSRF tokens, hidden fields)
- Early abort if first probe returns 400/403/415 (strict validation)
- Attempts to verify upload by fetching common upload directories
