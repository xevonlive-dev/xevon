	ModuleDesc = `## Description
JSON-RPC 2.0 supports batched arrays of requests. Some MCP servers gate
sensitive methods (` + "`tools/call`" + `, ` + "`resources/read`" + `) behind a successful
` + "`initialize`" + ` but apply the gate per-request, so a batch that bundles
` + "`initialize`" + ` and ` + "`tools/call`" + ` together processes both even though the
session was never actually established.

This module sends a batched array containing ` + "`initialize`" + ` and one or more
` + "`tools/list`" + ` / ` + "`tools/call`" + ` requests (without an Mcp-Session-Id) and
flags the server when the smuggled requests succeed.
