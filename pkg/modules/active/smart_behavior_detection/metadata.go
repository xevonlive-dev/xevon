Detects injection vulnerabilities through differential response analysis. Sends pairs
of semantically equivalent and different payloads and compares response behaviors.

## Notes
- Uses behavioral diffing: true/false payload pairs that should produce identical vs different responses
- Low confidence; serves as a triage signal for deeper investigation
