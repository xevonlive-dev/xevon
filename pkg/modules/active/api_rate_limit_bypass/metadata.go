	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects API rate limiting that can be bypassed using IP spoofing headers such as
X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, and similar headers. First triggers rate limiting by
sending rapid requests, then tests whether bypass headers circumvent the limit.

## Notes
- Runs once per host with internal deduplication
- Sends up to 10 rapid requests to trigger rate limiting
- Tests 8 different IP spoofing header variations
- Only reports when rate limiting is confirmed then bypassed
