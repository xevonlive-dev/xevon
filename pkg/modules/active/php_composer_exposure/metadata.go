Probes for Composer dependency management artifacts that should not be publicly
accessible: composer.json and composer.lock manifests revealing exact dependency
versions, vendor directory contents, Composer installed metadata, and PHPUnit
dev endpoint that may allow remote code execution.

## Notes
- Runs once per host to avoid redundant probing
- Validates responses with content markers to reduce false positives
- Fingerprints 404 responses to detect custom error pages
- PHPUnit eval-stdin.php is a known RCE vector in vulnerable versions
