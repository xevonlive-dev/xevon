Probes for common Rails ecosystem admin panels and background job dashboards that are
frequently mounted at predictable paths. Checks for Sidekiq, GoodJob, Resque, Delayed Job,
rack-mini-profiler, ActiveAdmin, and RailsAdmin.

## Notes
- Sends GET requests to known Rails dashboard paths
- Checks for framework-specific content markers in response bodies
- Reports both unauthenticated and auth-gated dashboards
- Fingerprints 404 responses to avoid false positives
