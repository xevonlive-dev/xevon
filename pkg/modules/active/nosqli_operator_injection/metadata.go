var (
	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Tests for NoSQL injection by injecting MongoDB query operators ($ne, $gt, $regex,
$where) and detecting authentication bypass, data exfiltration, and behavioral
changes. Complements nosqli_error_based by focusing on operator-level injection
rather than error messages.

## Notes
- Payload selection adapts to insertion point type (JSON, URL, body)
- Four detection modes: auth bypass, size increase, boolean differential, time delay
- Skips when NoSQL error patterns are detected (deferred to nosqli_error_based)
- Deduplicates by request hash manager
