Discovers GraphQL endpoints and tests them for common security misconfigurations including
enabled introspection, SQL injection through GraphQL arguments, and query batching abuse.

## Notes
- Probes 8 common GraphQL endpoint paths
- Tests both POST and GET request methods for endpoint discovery
- Checks for enabled introspection (information disclosure)
- Injects SQL payloads into discovered or common field arguments
- Tests for query batching support (rate limiting bypass)
- Runs once per host
