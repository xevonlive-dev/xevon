	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Fetches the FastAPI OpenAPI schema from /openapi.json and analyzes it for
authentication inconsistencies. Identifies operations that lack security
requirements, either because they explicitly opt out of global security
or because no security is defined at any level.

## Notes
- Runs once per host
- Parses /openapi.json for OpenAPI spec
- Flags operations under /api prefix without security requirements
- Optionally verifies by calling endpoints without auth
- FA-02: FastAPI auth inconsistency detection
