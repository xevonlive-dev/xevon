	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Probes for Rails-specific sensitive files that may be exposed due to misconfigured web
servers or containerized deployments serving the application root as static files.
Checks for master keys, encrypted credentials, database configs, Gemfiles, logs,
SQLite databases, and server configurations.

## Notes
- Sends GET/HEAD requests to known Rails configuration file paths
- Uses content markers to confirm file type and reduce false positives
- Fingerprints 404 responses to avoid custom error page false positives
- Each finding has severity based on the sensitivity of the exposed file
