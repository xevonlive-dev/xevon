	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Probes for exposed Spring Boot Admin (SBA) dashboards. SBA aggregates actuator
data from multiple registered Spring Boot services, providing a centralized
view of health, metrics, configuration, and environment details. An exposed
SBA dashboard can enable broad infrastructure compromise through access to
multiple services' actuator endpoints.

## Notes
- Runs once per host
- Checks common SBA paths: /admin, /boot-admin, /sba, /springbootadmin
- Validates using SBA-specific UI markers
- Fingerprints 404 responses to reduce false positives
