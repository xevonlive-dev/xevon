Actively tests ASP.NET ViewState security by tampering with ViewState MAC
validation, testing event validation bypass, detecting cookieless session
tokens in URLs, and checking for verbose error disclosure on ViewState
tampering.

## Notes
- Runs once per host
- Finds pages with __VIEWSTATE forms and tests MAC validation
- Tampers ViewState bytes and POSTs back to detect disabled MAC
- Submits forged __EVENTTARGET to detect disabled event validation
- Scans for cookieless session URL patterns (S(...)/)
- Checks if ViewState errors reveal stack traces
