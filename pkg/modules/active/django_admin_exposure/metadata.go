Probes for exposed Django admin panel. Django ships with a built-in admin
interface at /admin/ that provides full CRUD access to the application's data
models. An exposed admin panel increases attack surface and may allow brute
force or credential stuffing attacks against the admin login.

## Notes
- Runs once per host to avoid redundant probing
- Validates responses with Django admin-specific markers to reduce false positives
- Fingerprints 404 responses to detect custom error pages
- Admin index reported as medium severity; login page confirms admin is installed
