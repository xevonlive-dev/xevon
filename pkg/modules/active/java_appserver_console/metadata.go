Probes for exposed administration consoles of enterprise Java application servers
including WildFly/JBoss, Oracle WebLogic, and GlassFish/Payara. These admin
consoles are high-value targets as they enable application deployment, server
configuration, and often have known CVEs. Default or weak credentials can lead
to full server compromise.

## Notes
- Runs once per host
- Checks server-specific admin console paths
- Detects both accessible consoles and authentication challenges
- Validates using server-specific HTML and header markers
- Fingerprints 404 responses to reduce false positives
