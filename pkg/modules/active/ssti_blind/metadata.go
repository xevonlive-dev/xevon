Detects blind Server-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities using a dual approach:
OAST (Out-of-Band) callbacks via DNS lookups and time-delay payloads as a fallback.
OAST payloads use nslookup to trigger DNS callbacks, while time-delay payloads use
computationally expensive loops to cause measurable response delays.

## Notes
- Dual detection: OAST callbacks (Firm confidence) + time-delay fallback (Tentative confidence)
- OAST payloads target Jinja2, Mako, Freemarker, ERB, EJS, and Pebble engines
- Time-delay payloads target Jinja2, Twig, Mako, ERB, and Freemarker engines
- Time-delay uses triple verification (slow, fast, slow) to reduce false positives
- OAST findings arrive asynchronously via polling callbacks
