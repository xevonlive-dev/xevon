var (
	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects Angular template injection vulnerabilities by injecting math expressions inside
Angular template syntax (e.g., {{7*7}}) and checking if the computed result appears in
the response. This indicates the Angular engine is evaluating user-controlled expressions,
which can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution.

## Notes
- Tests basic Angular expression evaluation ({{mathA*mathB}})
- Tests Angular 1.x sandbox bypass via constructor chain
- Uses double confirmation with random math anchors to reduce false positives
- Each confirmation attempt uses different random values
- Checks that computed result appears in response but not in baseline
