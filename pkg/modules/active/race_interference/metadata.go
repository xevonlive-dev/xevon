Detects race condition vulnerabilities through parallel request analysis, looking for
input storage races, cross-request contamination, and request interference patterns.

## Notes
- Sends concurrent requests with different payloads and analyzes response variations
- Tests for TOCTOU and state mutation races
- Requires careful timing analysis
