Detects Broken Function-Level Authorization (BFLA) by testing admin and privileged
endpoints with missing or downgraded authentication. Strips Authorization and Cookie
headers, attempts empty tokens, and tests method switching on admin-like paths.

## Notes
- Runs once per unique host+path combination via DiskSet dedup
- Skips non-2xx original responses (only tests endpoints that currently succeed)
- Compares response status codes and body lengths to reduce false positives
- Heuristic-based detection targeting known admin/privileged path patterns
