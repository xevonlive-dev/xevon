	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Probes for PHP source code disclosure caused by misconfigured web servers: .phps
highlight handlers that expose syntax-highlighted source, alternate PHP extensions
(.phtml, .php5, .php7) that may serve source as plaintext, and PHP files served
as static content due to handler misconfiguration.

## Notes
- Runs once per host to avoid redundant probing
- Validates responses with PHP source code markers
- Detects both highlighted source and raw PHP code exposure
- Fingerprints 404 responses to detect custom error pages
