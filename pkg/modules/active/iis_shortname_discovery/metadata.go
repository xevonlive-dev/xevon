	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Detects and enumerates IIS 8.3 short filenames exposed through the tilde (~)
vulnerability. When IIS has short filename generation enabled, an attacker can
discover partial file and directory names by observing differential HTTP status
codes for wildcard-based requests.

The module performs three phases:
1. **Vulnerability detection** - tests HTTP methods and path suffixes to find a
   working oracle (distinct status codes for existing vs non-existing patterns)
2. **Character discovery** - identifies which characters appear in short filenames
   to minimize the enumeration search space
3. **Recursive enumeration** - brute-forces filenames character-by-character
   (up to 6 chars for name, 3 for extension per 8.3 convention)

## Notes
- Only runs on IIS servers (detected via Server, X-Powered-By, or X-AspNet-Version headers)
- Runs once per unique host
- Caps total requests at 2000 per host to avoid excessive traffic
- Reports discovered 8.3 short filenames (does not attempt full-name autocomplete)
