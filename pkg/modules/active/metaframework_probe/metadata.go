Probes for framework-specific internal files and debug endpoints exposed by modern
JavaScript meta-frameworks including Remix, Astro, and SvelteKit. These frameworks
may inadvertently expose manifest files, build directories, version information,
and development endpoints in production deployments.

## Notes
- Runs once per host with internal deduplication
- Tests 8 framework-specific paths across Remix, Astro, and SvelteKit
- Each probe has tailored response matching to reduce false positives
