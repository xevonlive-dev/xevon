var (
	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Extracts the Next.js version from client-side JavaScript bundles and maps it to
known security advisories. Checks for critical vulnerabilities including middleware
auth bypass (CVE-2025-29927), SSRF via Server Actions (CVE-2024-34351), cache
poisoning (CVE-2024-46982), and Server Actions DoS (CVE-2024-39693).

## Notes
- Active per-host scanner - sends requests to /_next/static/ paths
- Extracts version from JS bundle patterns (e.g., "Next.js <version>")
- Falls back to __NEXT_DATA__ build metadata analysis
- Maps extracted version against a local CVE advisory database
- Deduplicates by host
