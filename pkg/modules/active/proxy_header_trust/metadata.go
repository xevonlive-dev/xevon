	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Cross-framework detection of proxy header trust issues. Tests whether the application
blindly trusts X-Forwarded-Proto, X-Forwarded-Host, and X-Forwarded-For headers,
which can lead to host injection, protocol confusion, and IP-based access control bypass.

## Notes
- Runs once per host
- Sends baseline request then compares with header-injected variants
- X-Forwarded-Host reflected in Location or body indicates host injection (High)
- X-Forwarded-Proto behavior changes indicate protocol confusion (Medium)
- X-Forwarded-For bypassing restrictions indicates IP trust issues (High)
- CF-21, FA-05, FL-06, DJ-08: cross-framework proxy header trust detection
