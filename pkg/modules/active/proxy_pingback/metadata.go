var (
	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Probes for open proxy and callback endpoints by injecting OAST callback URLs into common
proxy-related URL paths. This detects endpoints that forward or fetch user-supplied URLs
(open proxy / blind SSRF).

## Notes
- Requires an interactsh server (configured via oast settings)
- Targets proxy-related paths: /proxy, /httpproxy, /callback, /url, /remote, etc.
- Appends OAST URLs via query parameters: url, src, proxy, callback, email, etc.
- Sends 54 probe requests per host covering path and parameter patterns
- Each host is tested only once (DiskSet dedup)
- Findings arrive asynchronously via the OAST polling callback
