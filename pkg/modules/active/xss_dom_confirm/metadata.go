Browser-confirmed XSS module. After a cheap pattern-matching pre-filter (response
reflection or DOM source-to-sink heuristics) flags a candidate, the module loads
the payload-armed URL in a real headless browser and observes JavaScript dialogs
(alert/confirm/prompt). A confirmed match means JavaScript actually executed —
no string-reflection guesswork.

## Notes
- Pre-filter runs first: never opens the browser unless reflection or a DOM
  source-to-sink pattern is present. Every pre-filter check is a single HTTP
  request the same as a regular reflected-XSS probe.
- Limited to URL-side insertion points (query params, path) where browser
  navigation can naturally carry the payload.
- Each confirmation spins up an isolated browser session via spitolas.ProbeURL,
  bounded by per-host and per-scan budgets.
- Uses a unique canary in the alert message so cross-talk from unrelated alerts
  is not mistaken for confirmation.
