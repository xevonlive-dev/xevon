Extracts Firebase Storage bucket names from crawled responses and probes
them for public listing and access via the Firebase Storage REST API
and Google Cloud Storage endpoints.

## Notes
- Extracts storageBucket from Firebase config in HTML/JS responses
- Tests object listing via Firebase Storage REST API
- Probes common prefixes: users/, uploads/, exports/, backups/
- Tests Google Cloud Storage endpoint for alternative public access
- Non-destructive: all probes are read-only GET requests
- Deduplicates by bucket name to avoid redundant probing
