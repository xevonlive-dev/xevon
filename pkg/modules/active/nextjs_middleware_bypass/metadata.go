Tests for Next.js middleware bypass vulnerabilities including CVE-2025-29927 and
path normalization issues. Next.js middleware runs before route handlers and is
commonly used for authentication. Certain header injections and path manipulations
can skip middleware execution entirely.

## Notes
- Only activates on 401/403 responses from Next.js hosts
- Tests x-middleware-subrequest header injection (CVE-2025-29927)
- Tests path normalization bypasses (double slashes, URL encoding, locale prefixes)
- Deduplicates with per-host limit (max 20 attempts per host)
- Validates bypass by checking status change from 401/403 to 200
