	ModuleDesc = `## Description
Probes for exposed Spring Cloud Gateway actuator endpoints that reveal routing
configuration, global filters, and route filter definitions. Exposed gateway
routes can disclose internal service topology, backend URLs, and rate limiting
configuration. Write-enabled gateway endpoints could allow route manipulation
for traffic steering and SSRF-style attacks.

## Notes
- Runs once per host
- Checks gateway-specific actuator paths
- Validates responses using gateway JSON markers
- Read-only probing (does not attempt route modification)
