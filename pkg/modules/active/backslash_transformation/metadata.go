Detects how servers handle backslash-escaped characters and special characters by injecting
escape sequences and analyzing transformations in the response.

## Notes
- Tests each insertion point for backslash consumption, escape interpretation, and unicode handling
- Useful as a precursor signal for deeper injection testing
