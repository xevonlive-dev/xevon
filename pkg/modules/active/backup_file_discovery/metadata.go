Discovers publicly accessible backup files by generating candidate filenames
from the target hostname parts, common backup names, and year variants, then
combining them with archive and backup extensions.

## Notes
- Runs once per unique host
- Generates ~600-900 candidate paths depending on hostname complexity
- Validates using 404 fingerprinting, Content-Type, Content-Length, and body differencing
- SQL/text dumps additionally checked for content markers (CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, etc.)
