Probes for Rails development-oriented endpoints that are commonly left exposed in
production deployments. Checks for informational pages (/rails/info), mailer previews
(/rails/mailers), Action Mailbox conductor UI, and health endpoints that leak metadata.

## Notes
- Sends GET requests to known Rails development endpoints
- Fingerprints 404 responses to avoid false positives from custom error pages
- Checks for Rails-specific content markers in response bodies
- Reports exposed endpoints with appropriate severity levels
