Detects Client-Side Template Injection vulnerabilities by injecting template expressions
(e.g., {{7*7}}) and checking if the expression is reflected literally (not HTML-encoded)
in the response body within a client-side template framework scope.

## Notes
- Different from server-side SSTI: checks for literal reflection, not evaluation
- Fingerprints AngularJS and Vue.js frameworks per-host (cached)
- Only scans hosts where a client-side template framework is detected
- Verifies the expression is not HTML-encoded (which would prevent exploitation)
- Uses double confirmation with random anchors to reduce false positives
