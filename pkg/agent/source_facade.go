// Source resolution, source-tree filtering, and target detection live in
// pkg/agent/source. These facades expose them under the agent.* namespace.
//
// They are kept deliberately, not as transitional shims: the leaf package is
// named "source", which collides with the ubiquitous `source` local variable
// across pkg/cli and pkg/server. Calling these through agent.* keeps every call
// site readable; importing pkg/agent/source directly would force a per-file
// import alias (e.g. agentsrc.ResolveSourceAndDiff) at almost every call site.
//
// Only the symbols actually used by callers are re-exported.
